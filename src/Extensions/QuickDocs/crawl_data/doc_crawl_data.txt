## Brush Types
Pixelorama comes with three default brushes, the usual pixel/square brush, a hollow circle and a filled circle brush. These brushes are based on algorithms, while all of the other brushes as of right now are based on image data. The main difference is that the image-based brushes are scaled the same way that images are being scaled, which may not always have the result we desire. The image-based brushes are also divided into two types, File brushes and Project brushes. File brushes are stored as external `.png` files, while project brushes are stored in the [project](project) itself. File brushes can also be Random brushes. Each time you draw using a random brush, the result will be something different!
Image-based brushes will also have one extra option in the tool settings; a \"Brush Color From\" slider which goes from 0 to 100. If it's set to 0, the resulting color(s) of the brush will come entirely from the image data themselves. Otherwise, if set to 100, the brush color will come from the currently selected color. This setting is important to have because, since image-based brushes rely on image data, this means that they also get to keep the original colors of the image data.",
"brush.md/Making Your Own Custom Brushes(1)": "
## Making Your Own Custom Brushes
### File Brushes
Pixelorama gives you the option to create your own custom brushes, which you can later use to draw. There are two brush types, File and Project brushes. File brushes are `.png` files saved in the `pixelorama_data/Brushes` directory. They are available for all projects. To create a \"File\" custom brush, all you need to do is create your brush and save it as a `.png` file in the `pixelorama_data/Brushes` directory. They will be found on the \"File\" tab.
![File brushes tab](../../static/img/file_brushes.png)
### Random Brushes
To make a random brush, save your sprites as multiple `.png` files, with `\"~\"` at the beginning of their filename, and save them in the same sub-directory. For example, if you want to save a grass random brush, you can create a `pixelorama_data/Brushes/Grass` directory, and name the files something like `~Grass1.png`, `~Grass2.png`, `~Grass3.png`, `~Grass4.png`, and so on. The more files you add, the more variation (random values) your random brush will have.
![Random brush files](../../static/img/grass_random_brush.png)
### Project Brushes
Project brushes are project-dependent, which means that they're not available for all projects. They are saved inside `.pxo` files. To create a Project brush you can [select](../user_manual/selecting) the part of the drawing you want to save as brush, and press <kbd>Control + B</kbd> or go to Edit, New Brush. They will be found on the \"Project\" tab.
![Project brushes tab](../../static/img/project_brushes.png)",
"canvas.md": "
![Pixelorama's Canvas](../../../static/img/canvas.png)
The canvas is the area where your drawing is located and it's also where you apply all of the tools at your disposal. While you can scroll around the canvas without limits, you cannot draw outside the canvas's boundaries, which are set by the size of the image. Of course, you can always resize the project to expand or shrink your canvas's limits.",
"canvas.md/Grid(1)": "
## Grid
The grid is an important tool that aids the user in accurately drawing lines. Currently, Pixelorama has two types of grids, rectangular and isometric. The rectangular grid is what you will probably use most of the time, while the isometric grid is great if you are making isometric art, like the one pictured below.
![Isometric Grid](../../../static/img/canvas_isometric_grid.png)
### Editing the Grid
The grid's properties can be edited in the Preferences, which is found under the Edit menu, and then selecting \"Canvas\" on the left side. The option includes the grid type itself (rectangular, isometric or both), the width and height of the rectangular grid, the width and height of the isometric bounds of the cells, the x and y offset of the grid, the grid color and whether to draw over Tile Mode.
To toggle its visibility, you can click on \"Show Grid\" in the View menu, or by pressing <kbd>Control + G</kbd>.
### Pixel Grid
The Pixel Grid is a rectangular 1x1 grid that appears after a certain zoom level. You can change its color and after which zoom level it appears at the same place as the rest of the grid options.
To toggle its visibility, you can click on \"Show Pixel Grid\" in the View menu, or by pressing <kbd>Control + H</kbd>.",
"canvas.md/Navigation(0)": "
## Navigation
You can navigate around the canvas in multiple ways.
### Zoom
To zoom, you can use the mouse wheel. Scroll the wheel up to zoom in, and down to zoom out. You can also use <kbd>+</kbd> on your keyboard to zoom in and <kbd>-</kbd> to zoom out. You can see the current zoom level of the canvas in the top bar of the user interface.
There is also a dedicated zoom tool, which you can use like any other tool, by pressing either the left or the right mouse button, depending on where you mapped it. The zoom tool can prove useful for users with no mouse, such as graphics tablet or touch screen users. From the tool's options, you can switch it to either zoom in or out, and you can also find two buttons.
![Zoom tool options](../../../static/img/tooloptions_zoom.png)
The first one is \"Fit to frame\" which basically centers your canvas and makes it as big as possible without any portion of it not being visible.
The second one is 100% zoom. This basically makes the canvas its exact pixel dimensions based on your screen. For example, if your canvas is 64x64 pixels, pressing this button will make the canvas appear on a 64x64 area of your screen. This gives you an idea of how your art looks at its original dimensions.
### Pan
You can pan by either holding the middle mouse button or <kbd>Space</kbd> on your keyboard and simply moving the mouse. You can also use the arrow keys to move around. Like with zoom, there is also a dedicated pan tool.
### Mirror
You can mirror your view horizontally and non-destructively by going to the View menu and clicking \"Mirror View\", or by pressing <kbd>Shift + M</kbd>.",
"canvas.md/Rulers and Guides(4)": "
## Rulers and Guides
On the top and left sides of the canvas, you can find two rulers. These serve two purposes, the first is to let the user easily and effortlessly measure distances in pixels, and the second is to create guides by clicking on them with the left mouse button and, while it's being held, dragging the cursor to the position you want your guide to be at. Guides are either horizontal or vertical lines that can be used as references to help you properly align stuff on your canvas.
### Editing Guides
To move an already created guide, you can drag the guide by clicking and holding the left mouse button while your cursor is pointing at the guide but it's also **outside the canvas boundaries**. If it's not, it will simply apply your currently selected tool. If the guide is completely moved outside the canvas area, it will be removed.
You can also change their colors by going to Edit, Preferences, Canvas.
### Toggling Visibility
You can also easily hide the rulers and the guides from the View menu. <kbd>Control + R</kbd> toggles the visibility of the rulers, and <kbd>Control + F</kbd> toggles the visibility of the guides.",
"canvas.md/Second Canvas(3)": "
## Second Canvas
On the right side of the canvas, there is a grabber. Moving it to the left will reveal a second canvas. The purpose of this is to easily preview your artwork in different positions or zoom levels. As of right now, you **cannot** draw on it.",
"canvas.md/Tile Mode(2)": "
## Tile Mode
If you are working with tiles, it might be useful to preview them in such a way so you can see if they repeat seamlessly. For this reason, you can enable Tile Mode, which repeats the canvas in multiple dimensions around the central area. To enable Tile Mode, you can go to the View menu, hover on Tile Mode and select what you want. \"None\" will disable Tile Mode, \"Tiled in Both Axis\" will repeat the canvas horizontally, vertically and diagonally, and the other two options will just repeat it either horizontally or vertically. It is also possible to draw in the tiled area.",
"canvas.md/Transparent Background(5)": "
## Transparent Background
If you are working with a drawing that has transparent pixels, a checkerboard background will appear there. Its purpose is to simply show that these areas are transparent. The background itself is **not part of your drawing**. Meaning, it will not be exported along with the final image.
### Editing the transparent background
You can edit the checkerboard background by going to the Edit menu, Preferences, and selecting Canvas. The options include the size of the checkers in pixels, the two colors that make up the checkerboard, and whether they follow the canvas movement and zoom level. If both \"Follow Canvas Movement\" and \"Follow Canvas Zoom Level\" are toggled on, the checkerboard matches exactly the pixels of the canvas that you draw and will pretty much act as a second grid.",
"cel.md": "
In Pixelorama, the term \"Cel\" (from [celluloid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cel)) refers to the intersection of frames and layers of the project. Basically, every frame in a project has as many cels as there are layers. You could think of frames as a collection of cels, for every layer. So for example, if the project has 3 frames and 4 layers, each frame would have 4 cels, making the total cels 3 x 4 = 12.
![Timeline Cels](../../static/img/timeline_cels.png)
Cels can be found in the timeline. They are the square buttons you can click to edit. You can select/deselect multiple by holding the <kbd>Control</kbd> key and left-clicking individual cels, or hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key and left-click a cel to also select all of the cels between the one that was clicked and the one that has been selected last.",
"cel.md/Linked cels(0)": "
## Linked cels
You can also right-click cels, that belong to a pixel layer, to link them together. Linked cels share the same image data, meaning that if you make changes to one linked cel, the changes are shared with all other linked cels. Keep in mind that, as of right now, linked cels are layer-local. You cannot have cels linked that belong to different layers, only different frames. Linked cels are marked with a colored rectangle behind their preview.",
"cel.md/Z-Index(1)": "
## Z-Index
Z-index can be edited through the cel properties, and it is used to change the ordering of individual cels independently of the layer they are in, making them appear behind, or in front of other cels in different layers. The default value of 0 means that the cel's ordering is the same as its layer's. Positive values move it to the front, and negative values move it to the back.",
"cli.md": "
Pixelorama offers a Command Line Interface (CLI), allowing you to use some of its features, such as project [exporting](save_and_export), from the command line. The CLI can be used to automate tasks easily. It can only be used on desktop platforms, such as Windows, Linux and macOS.",

"color_mode.md": "
As of right now, Pixelorama supports the **RGBA** and **Indexed** color modes for its [projects](project). You can choose a color mode when creating a new project, or at any time during the editing of a project, by going to the Image menu, and selecting a color mode from the \"Color mode\" submenu.",
"color_mode.md/Indexed(1)": "
## Indexed
When using the indexed color mode, each pixel contains a number that references the index of a color in the [palette](../user_manual/palettes). This means that the pixels do not have their own independent color values. Instead, they get their color from the palette, depending on the index number they contain. This essentially means that if a pixel contains the number \"3\", its color will be the same as the 3rd color of the currently selected palette. Changing that color in the palette, or even switching to a new palette, will change all of the colors of the image that are also mapped to the 3rd palette color. Re-ordering the colors of the palette also affect the image. If the 3rd color in the palette is a blue color and the 4th is a green one, moving the green one into the 3rd spot, will make all of the previously blue pixels of the image green, as they will remain mapped to the 3rd color of the palette, whatever that is.
To change the color of the pixels, simply pick the color you want from the palette, and use a drawing [tool](../user_manual/tools) on the pixels you want. If you freely select a color from the color picker, it will not be applied to the image. Instead, Pixelorama will automatically find the closest color from the currently active palette, and apply that instead.
This mode is used when you want to limit the colors of your project to a specific palette, and when you want changes in the palette to be reflected immediately to all pixels of the image.",
"color_mode.md/RGBA(0)": "
## RGBA
RGBA is the default color mode. It stands for Red, Green, Blue and Alpha. When using this color mode, each pixel of the image contains four values: a red value, a green value, a blue value and an alpha value. The first three values make up the color of the pixel, and the alpha value contains its transparency.",

"drawing.md": "
Drawing is the main feature of Pixelorama and it's what you will be doing most of the time. There are multiple tools that can be used for drawing in the [canvas](user_interface/canvas), with the main one being the **Pencil** tool.",
"drawing.md/Bucket(2)": "
## Bucket
The bucket tool is a quick way to paint large sections of the image. You can select one of two fill areas. \"Same color area\" will fill the area around the mouse click position that is the same color as the pixel on mouse position with the selected color, using a [flood fill algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill). \"Same color pixels\" will change all of the pixels of the selected [cels](../concepts/cel) of the same color as the one on mouse position with the selected color.
You can also choose to fill with patterns instead of a color.",
"drawing.md/Color Picker(4)": "
## Color Picker
This one is fairly simple to comprehend. While not a drawing tool itself, the color picker tool is used for getting a sample of an existing color on the canvas with the purpose of replicating it, depending on which pixel the selection is done at.
Now, there's only one category available as an option for the time being, called \"Pick for:\". This means that the sample taken will replace one of the colors, either the **Left Color** or **Right Color**. Choosing **Left Color** replaces the left selected color, while right replaces the right selected color.
:::tip Quick access
You can quickly access the color picker **without changing tools** by simply holding <kbd>Alt</kbd> and <kbd>Left/Right Click</kbd> the desired color to assign it to Left or Right tools respectively.
:::
:::tip Quick access
Another quick and helpful way to use the color picker is having it mapped to your **right mouse button** and having the **Left Color** option selected while having a drawing tool mapped to your **left mouse button.** The color picker can complement the drawing tool by selecting the color you next desire to paint with, making it an immediate way of switching between hues.

"drawing.md/Mirroring(5)": "
## Mirroring
All drawing tools can work with symmetry. Symmetry in Pixelorama is either horizontal, vertical or both at the same time. It can be enabled from the tool options. If, for example, horizontal symmetry is enabled, whatever you draw will get mirrored, meaning it will also get drawn on the other horizontal side, having the same distance from the symmetry line as your original drawing. So if you draw a pixel two pixels from the left of the vertical symmetry line and horizontal symmetry is enabled, then the pixel two pixels from the right of the symmetry line and on the same vertical position will also get drawn. The same holds true when vertical symmetry is enabled.
If you have both horizontal and vertical mirroring enabled, then the drawn pixels will get repeated four times.",
"drawing.md/Pencil and Eraser(1)": "
## Pencil and Eraser
The main tools of Pixelorama. Used to draw or erase pixels at an individual pixel level. You can select from multiple [brushes](../concepts/brush) and change their size. You can also hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> before drawing to create lines between two points, and by also holding <kbd>Control</kbd>, you constrain them either by 15 degrees, or always making them be pixel-perfect angles by having the \"Pixel Perfect\" option enabled.
The eraser erases pixels by simply subtracting their color RGBA value by the given opacity value. If the opacity value is 255 then the color RGBA value becomes (0, 0, 0 ,0), which is equivalent to black that is completely transparent.
### Pencil Tool Options
The Pencil tool also has an \"Overwrite Color\" tool option. If this is enabled, the color of the drawn pixels will always become the same color as the selected one. Otherwise, if the colors are transparent, their alpha values will blend. For example, if the color of the drawn pixels have are 30% transparent and your currently selected color is 25% transparent, the resulting transparency will be 55%. While if the overwrite color option is on, the resulting transparency will always be 25%.
The \"Fill inside\" option fills the entire area with the selected color between the first mouse-clicked position and the last, after the mouse button gets released.
### Pixel Perfect
The Pencil and Eraser (and [Shading](shading)!) tools have an option called \"Pixel Perfect\". This essentially creates \"pixel perfect\" lines for you by automatically removing the middle pixel of L-shapes. In other words, it removes extra adjacent pixels often referred to as \"doubles\" in order to create lines that are one-pixel thick.

"drawing.md/Shape tools(3)": "
## Shape tools
The shape tools include the line tool, rectangle tool and ellipse tool. All of them are very straightforward to use; you click on where you want to place your shape, hold your mouse button and finally release it on where you want your shape to end. You can also change the shape's thickness, and for the rectangle and ellipse tools, you can choose whether to create hollow or filled with color shapes.
Similar to the [selection tools](selection), you can use keyboard shortcuts to modify how the shapes are being created.
- Mouse click + <kbd>Shift</kbd> = Create a 1:1 (square/circle) shape. For the line tool, <kbd> Shift</kbd> will restrain the angle to be pixel perfect, similar to how <kbd>Control</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> do for the Pencil tool.
- Mouse click + <kbd>Control</kbd> = Create a shape that expands from the center.
- Mouse click + <kbd>Alt</kbd> = Displaces the origin of the shape.",

To ensure your work isn't accidentally lost, it is highly recommended that you use version control (e.g Git) in your extension project.

1. First of all make a new Godot project of name \"Example\" (the project name is irrelevant but for simplicity we'll name it the same as our extension).
2. After that make a directory structure as shown in the image below.
![Extension File Structure](../../static/img/extension_structure.png)
##### The File Structure of any basic extension.
In the \"Example\" folder you can see three files;
- extension.json
- Main.tscn
- Main.gd
These files are the bare minimum required for an extension to function properly. Let's go through each of them one by one:
### extension.json
The `extension.json` file serves as a basic configuration file for the extension. A proper `extension.json` file should contain the below content
```
{
    \"name\": \"Example\",
    \"display_name\": \"Anything you want\",
    \"description\": \"What the extension does\",
    \"author\": \"Your Name\",
    \"version\": \"0.1\",
	\"supported_api_versions\": [4],
    \"license\": \"MIT\",
    \"nodes\": [
        \"Main.tscn\"
    ]
}
```
| Key      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| name | The extension name (in this case Example). |
| display_name | The name actually shown by Pixelorama in it's extension list (it can be anything). |
| author | Author of the extension. |
| version | version of the extension, it is a floating value so versions like 20.1.7 etc. are invalid. |
| supported_api_versions | (Optional) Announces the Api level of the extension. Pixelorama uses this to check compatibility between versions. |
| license | Name of license used by the extension. |
| nodes | Array containing name of scenes that should be instanced as soon extension gets enabled (in this case it is `Main.tscn`). |
:::tip Api Versions
`supported_api_versions` is an optional key that is used by Pixelorama to determine if it is compatible with it's Api ( E.g `[ 3 ]` means you are making extension for Pixelorama 0.11.x). If your extension is compatible with multiple api e.g (level 2 and 3) then use `[ 2, 3 ]`. To find the Api level of Pixelorama open the `project.godot` file in **Pixelorama's Source** and look for `config/ExtensionsAPI_Version`
:::
### Main.tscn
As mentioned above, the `Main.tscn` will be instanced in Pixelorama as soon as the extension gets enabled. a GdScript file (In this case `Main.gd`) is attached to this scene.
### Main.gd
As mentioned above, the `Main.gd` is a script written in GdScript, that will be run as soon as the extension gets enabled. It can be used to
- Instance further scenes (.tscn files).
- Or contain the core extension code.
The content of a basic `Main.gd` file is;
```
extends Node
# NOTE: use get_node_or_null(\"/root/ExtensionsApi\") to access the extension api.
# Runs as soon as extension is enabled. This script can act as a setup for the extension.
func _enter_tree() -> void:
	pass
func _exit_tree() -> void:  # Extension is being uninstalled or disabled
	# remember to remove things that you added using this extension
	pass
```",
"extension_examples.md": "
:::caution code version
The examples below assume you are developing for the latest Pixelorama release
:::
Below are some example codes for different basic types of extensions. To use them, [create an extension](extension_basics#making-an-extension) and paste your desired code from here to `Main.gd`;
- [Bare Minimum](#bare-minimum)
- [Add new Tab](#add-new-tab)
- [Add Menu Item](#add-menu-item)
- [Change Font](#change-font)
- [Project Manipulation](#project-manipulation)
- [Custom Exporter](#custom-exporter)
### Bare Minimum
The most basic code.
```
extends Node
# This script acts as a setup for the extension
func _enter_tree() -> void:
	pass
func _exit_tree() -> void:  # Extension is being uninstalled or disabled
	# remember to remove things that you added using this extension
	pass
```
### Add new Tab
Adds a simple Panel as a tab, which will be placed at the same place as the Tools tab by default.
```
extends Node
@onready var extension_api: Node  # Variable for keeping reference to the Api
# some references to nodes that will be created later
var panel
# This script acts as a setup for the extension
func _enter_tree() -> void:
	extension_api = get_node_or_null(\"/root/ExtensionsApi\")  # Accessing the Api
	# add a test panel as a tab  (this is an example) the tab is located at the same
	# place as the (Tools tab) by default
	panel = Panel.new()
	panel.name = \"This is a new panel\"  # This is optional
	extension_api.panel.add_node_as_tab(panel)
func _exit_tree() -> void:  # Extension is being uninstalled or disabled
	# remember to remove things that you added using this extension
	extension_api.panel.remove_node_from_tab(panel)
```
### Add Menu Item
Adds a menu item in Help menu, which displays a message when clicked on it.
```
extends Node
@onready var extension_api: Node  # Variable for keeping reference to the Api
var item_id: int
# This script acts as a setup for the extension
func _enter_tree() -> void:
	extension_api = get_node_or_null(\"/root/ExtensionsApi\")  # Accessing the Api
	var type = extension_api.menu.HELP
	item_id = extension_api.menu.add_menu_item(type, \"Show Message\", self)
	# the 3rd argument (in this case \"self\") will try to call \"menu_item_clicked\"
	# (if it is present)
func menu_item_clicked():
	# Do some stuff
	extension_api.dialog.show_error(\"You Tickled Me :)\")
func _exit_tree() -> void:  # Extension is being uninstalled or disabled
	# remember to remove things that you added using this extension
	extension_api.menu.remove_menu_item(extension_api.menu.HELP, item_id)
```
### Add a Theme
Adds a theme to pixelorama **Preferences > Interface > Themes** (you need to have a theme resource beforehand and that theme resource must derive from one of the [main pixelorama themes](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/tree/master/assets/themes))
```
extends Node
@onready var extension_api: Node  # Variable for keeping reference to the Api
var theme = load(\"res://path_to_some_theme.tres\") # Replace this with your theme resource
# your theme resource must be a derivative of themes from
# https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/tree/master/assets/themes
# or else a CRASH might occur
# if a theme from the extension was set in preferences, then it will be automatically be
# set when pixelorama is launched again
func _enter_tree() -> void:
	extension_api = get_node_or_null(\"/root/ExtensionsApi\")  # Accessing the Api
	if theme:
		extension_api.theme.add_theme(theme)  # Adds the theme to preferences
func _exit_tree() -> void:  # Extension is being uninstalled or disabled
	if theme:
		extension_api.theme.remove_theme(theme)  # Adds the theme to preferences
```
### Change Font
Sometimes you only need a different font instead of a different theme. This is much easier to achieve than adding themes.(you need to have a `.ttf` font resource beforehand)
```
extends Node
# used If your goal is to only use a different font
@onready var extension_api: Node  # Variable for keeping reference to the Api
var font_res = load(\"res://path_to_some_font.ttf\")  # Replace this with your font resource
var old_font
# This script acts as a setup for the extension
func _enter_tree() -> void:
	extension_api = get_node_or_null(\"/root/ExtensionsApi\")  # Accessing the Api
	if font_res:
		old_font = extension_api.general.get_global().control.theme.default_font.font_data
		#set the new font
		extension_api.general.get_global().control.theme.default_font.font_data = font_res
func _exit_tree() -> void:
	if font_res and old_font:
		#set the default font back again
		extension_api.general.get_global().control.theme.default_font.font_data = old_font
```
### Project Manipulation
Wish to automate some project behaviour? this will demonstrate some of the basic functions provided by the project api. This example adds a menu button to the edit menu and on clicking it some project manipulations (instructed in `menu_item_clicked()`) will get carried out.
```
extends Node
# I will show you some common stuff to manipulate projects
# (I will make use of the menu api as well)
# To know the available methods of (timeline) see:
# https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/blob/master/src/UI/Timeline/AnimationTimeline.gd
# NOTE: some more advanced methods can be accessed from timeline node (un-comment line below to get them)
#@onready var timeline = ExtensionsApi.general.get_global().animation_timeline
@onready var extension_api: Node  # Variable for keeping reference to the Api
var item_id: int
var type: int
func _enter_tree() -> void:
	extension_api = get_node_or_null(\"/root/ExtensionsApi\")  # Accessing the Api
	type = extension_api.menu.EDIT
	item_id = extension_api.menu.add_menu_item(type, \"Click Me 4 times\", self)
func _exit_tree() -> void:  # Extension is being uninstalled or disabled
	# remember to remove things that you added using this extension
	extension_api.menu.remove_menu_item(type, item_id)
################## Test Project methods whenever we click the menu button ############
var thing_to_do := 0
var new_project
var dest_img: Image
func menu_item_clicked():
	# Do some stuff
	if thing_to_do == 0:
		# get an image (For testing) from the current cel
		dest_img = extension_api.project.get_current_cel().get_image()
		# also make a new project
		var frames := Array([], TYPE_OBJECT, &\"RefCounted\", load(\"res://src/Classes/Frame.gd\"))
		new_project = extension_api.project.new_project(frames, \"Test\", Vector2(64, 64))
	if thing_to_do == 1:
		# To change something or get something in a project we must make it our \"current_project\" first
		extension_api.project.switch_to(new_project)
	if thing_to_do == 2:
		# Add 3 frames (the new_project will now have 4 total frames)
		for i in range(3):
			extension_api.project.add_new_frame(0)
	if thing_to_do == 3:
		# Add a PixelLayer
		extension_api.project.add_new_layer(0, \"I Love Pixelorama\")
	if thing_to_do == 4:
		# Now change content at {frame 3, layer 1} of \"new_project\"
		extension_api.project.set_pixelcel_image(dest_img, 2, 0)  # {frame 3, layer 1}
	thing_to_do += 1
```
### Custom Exporter
Adds a basic custom exporter that will export only odd frames. 
```
extends Node
@onready var extension_api: Node  # Variable for keeping reference to the Api
var id: int
func _enter_tree() -> void:
	extension_api = get_node_or_null(\"/root/ExtensionsApi\")  # Accessing the Api
	var exporter_info := {\"extension\": \".png\", \"description\": \"Only Alternate Frames\"}
	id = extension_api.exports.add_export_option(
		exporter_info, self, extension_api.exports.ExportTab.IMAGE, false
	)  # 2nd argument (in this case \"self\") must have \"override_export()\" in it's script
func _exit_tree() -> void:
	# remember to remove things that you added using this extension
	extension_api.exports.remove_export_option(id)
func override_export(details: Dictionary) -> bool:
	# in this function you take control of image processing and saving from pixelorama
	# return true for SUCCESS, false for FAILURE
	# the (details) include everything you could possibly need for exporting
	# keys of (details) are:
	# \"processed_images\", \"durations\", \"export_dialog\", \"export_paths\", \"project\"
	for i in range(0, details[\"processed_images\"].size(), 2):
		var image: Image = details[\"processed_images\"][i]
		var error = image.save_png(details[\"export_paths\"][i])
		if error != OK:
			return false
	return true

"extensions_api.md": ":::tip
This is the documentation for Api version 5
:::
### Description
This Api gives you the essentials to develop a working extension for Pixelorama. To keep things organized, the Api is divided into
many smaller Apis, each giving access to different areas of the Software;
To access this anywhere in the extension use `get_node_or_null(\"/root/ExtensionsApi\")` e.g.
``` 
var api = get_node_or_null(\"/root/ExtensionsApi\")
```
:::tip
Keep in mind that this API is targeted towards users who are not fully familiar with Pixelorama's source code. If you need to do something more complicated and more low-level, you would need to interact directly with the source code.

Yes! Read our [Ways to Contribute](development_and_contributing) page to learn more.",
"faq.md/Q: Does Pixelorama work on the Steam Deck?(4)": "
## Q: Does Pixelorama work on the Steam Deck?
A: It should! It works on Linux, so it should work on Steam Deck as well. Pixelorama also supports gamepad shortcuts, so you should be able to map the Steam Deck's buttons to actions such as undo/redo, copy, paste, etc. The reason we're not 100% certain is because we don't currently own a Steam Deck to test it ourselves.",
"faq.md/Q: How much does Pixelorama cost?(0)": "
## Q: How much does Pixelorama cost?
A: Pixelorama is available for the *extremely cheap price of $0.00!* That's right! Pixelorama is a [free and open-source software (FOSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), available under the (very permissive) [MIT license](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/blob/master/LICENSE)!

"faq.md/Q: Is Pixelorama safe?(5)": "
## Q: Is Pixelorama safe?
A: Pixelorama is completely safe, as long as you download it from official sources (see `Q: What platforms is Pixelorama available on?` above). Its open-source nature allows for perfect transparency, thus it is impossible for us to sneak in malicious code without anyone noticing. The official builds are also being generated directly from the source code using GitHub Actions, so there is no worry that someone is sneaking in malicious code in the process of compiling. You may, however, get some security warnings from security software, such as Windows SmartScreen. The reason for this is that Pixelorama is not signed, and thus not recognized by the security system. You can safely ignore these warnings and proceed to run Pixelorama.",
"faq.md/Q: What are the minimum system requirements to run Pixelorama?(3)": "

## Q: What benefits does the Steam version provide?
A: Users who buy Pixelorama through Steam will enjoy the benefits that Steam provides to all of the games and software hosted there, such as automatic updates and Steam Achievements. It is also a great way to fund the project's development! Apart from that, there will be no other difference between the non-Steam version. All of Pixelorama's features will be the same in all versions, and all versions will receive the same updates. In other words, the Steam version will **not** be a \"Pro\" version. It will be exactly the same as the non-Steam version, just with the added benefits that come naturally from Steam.",
"faq.md/Q: What engine is being used to develop Pixelorama? Where is the code hosted?(8)": "
## Q: What engine is being used to develop Pixelorama? Where is the code hosted?

"faq.md/Q: Why is Godot used to develop Pixelorama?(9)": "
## Q: Why is Godot used to develop Pixelorama?
A: Mostly because it's easy to use, while being powerful at the same time. If we started Pixelorama using plain C++ or something like that it would be much more primitive and the development would be a lot slower. Features such as the image and layer effects, 3D layers, the extension system and others would be a lot harder to implement without Godot. Most of the community came from Godot, so if Godot wasn't used, it would also be less popular and it would have less contributors, leading to even less features and polish. Godot handles a lot of stuff for us already behind the scenes, and pretty much most major Godot releases also bring visible improvements to Pixelorama without us having to do big changes. Having to do all of that from scratch would be exhausting.
Pixelorama started as an experiment to see if making such a software in Godot is possible. The first time we showed it to Godot's community, we mostly did it to show what we could do with Godot, We weren't expecting anyone to actually use it, but we did want to make a proper pixel art software so we decided to keep improving it so it would become usable.",
"faq.md/Q: Will Pixelorama ever become Godot's Plugin?(11)": "
## Q: Will Pixelorama ever become Godot's Plugin?
A: Pixelorama was originally created as a stand-alone program. Our current focus is to keep improving it and not implementing it into Godot itself, but we are not declining the possibility of it being a plugin one day. However, if you are interested in direct Pixelorama support from Godot, you can use the amazing [Importality plugin](https://github.com/nklbdev/godot-4-importality) which can be used to make Godot import pxo files. For best results, make sure to enable \"Include blended images\" when saving your pxo files from Pixelorama.",
"image_effects.md": "
You can apply multiple image effects to an image, to easily and quickly affect its content, without modifying it pixel by pixel. The image effects can be found under the Image menu.
:::warning
Image effects are **destructive**. This means that, once they are applied, they directly modify the image data, and the only way to reverse this change is by undoing. If you want to use a non-destructive workflow, use [layer effects](../concepts/layer#layer-effects) instead.

"image_effects.md/Animate image effects(2)": "
## Animate image effects
Some of these image effects can be animated. To animate an image effect, first create as many frames as you want the animation to last for, and select them. Then, open the image effect dialog you desire, and click on the small play icon on the top right side of the dialog. A new dialog will appear, containing all of the animatable properties. Select the property you wish to animate, toggle \"Animate\" on, and put the initial and final values, as well as the ease type and interpolation. Once you're done, click on \"OK\" on the image effect dialog, and the image effect will be applied to all of the selected frames, with the animatable properties you chose being automatically interpolated based on the position of each frame. This method can be used to easily make something move, rotate, etc, without having to edit each frame manually.
:::tip Affect active selection
By default, image effects will affect only the selected area of the cel(s). If there is no active selection, the entire cel(s) will be affected. If you have an active selection but want to affect the entire image, you can toggle off the \"Only affect selection\" checkbox in the dialog of the image effect you wish to apply.
:::
:::tip Affecting multiple cels at once
By default, image effects will apply in all of the currently selected cels. It is also possible to make them apply to the entire selected frame, to all frames of the project, and to all projects as well, by selecting one of these options from the option button found next to the \"Only affect selection\" checkbox, in the dialog of the image effect you wish to apply.

"image_effects.md/List of image effects(0)": "
## List of image effects
| Name      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Offset | Moves the pixels of the image to a new position. The moved pixels can optionally be wrapped around when they go out of bounds. For example, if a pixel leaves the canvas from the right, it re-appears on the left side. |
| Mirror | Mirrors the content of the image horizontally, vertically or both. |
| Rotate | Rotates the content of the image. Can change the angle, the pivot point, as well as the algorithm. There are seven rotation algorithms to choose from: Rotxel with Smear, cleanEdge, OmniScale, Nearest Neighbor (Shader), Nearest Neighbor, Rotxel and \"Upscale, Rotate and Downscale\". The first four are shader-based, meaning that they use the GPU, while the rest use the CPU. The algorithms that use the GPU tend to be faster. Rotxel with Smear can also create a smearing effect. |
| Invert colors | Inverts the colors of the image. Can choose whether this affects the red, blue, green or alpha channels, or multiple at once. |
| Desaturation | Desaturates the colors of the image, turning them to grayscale. Can choose whether this affects the red, blue, green or alpha channels, or multiple at once. |
| Adjust Hue/Saturation/Value | Adjusts the hue, saturation and the value of the image's colors. |
| Adjust Brightness/Contrast | Adjusts the brightness, contrast, and even the saturation, RGB values and tint color of the image's colors. |
| Color Curves | Adjusts the RGB, Red, Green, Blue, Alpha, Hue, Saturation and Value channels of the image using curves. |
| Palettize | Limits the number of colors of the image to the colors of the currently active palette. Each color is being mapped to the nearest color in the palette. |
| Posterize | Limits the number of colors of the image to the posterization level. Can also set an optional dither intensity. |
| Gradient map | Converts the colors of the image into a gradient, based on their lightness. Darker colors are mapped to colors on the left side of the gradient, and brighter colors are mapped to colors on the right side of the gradient. |
| Outline | Generates an outline, with a given thickness, color and pattern. The outline is being generated outside the pixels that have transparent pixels are neighbors. If \"place inside image\" is toggled on, the outline is being drawn on these pixels themselves, rather than outside them. |
| Drop shadow | Creates a shadow of the image's content at a given offset, with a given color. |
| Gradient | Generates a gradient. Its colors can be modified from the gradient edit, by clicking on the colored area to add new color steps. Clicking on the color steps with the left mouse allows you to change the color of that step, and right clicking on a step, removes it. Gradients can either be linear or radial, and they can optionally be dithered and/or repeated. You can also generate step gradients by changing the interpolation type to constant. |
| Pixelize | Pixelates the image by combining its pixels into larger squares, containing their average color. |
| Gaussian Blur | Blurs the image. Users can choose the blur type, amount, radius and direction. |",
"image_effects.md/Loading custom effects(1)": "
## Loading custom effects
It is possible to load Godot 4 canvas_item shaders as custom effects in Pixelorama. You can make a shader yourself either by coding it yourself in the [Godot Shading Language](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/shaders/shader_reference/shading_language.html), or by using Godot's editor to make a [Visual Shader](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/shaders/visual_shaders.html). Alternatively, you can find ready to use shaders made by other people online. One of the best places to look for Godot shaders is https://godotshaders.com/shader-type/canvas_item/.
To load a shader, you can drag and drop the shader file from your file editor into Pixelorama. The file extension of code shaders is `.gdshader`, and of visual shaders is `.tres`. Then, you can find the effect under the Effects menu, under the \"Loaded\" subcategory. If you want to use it as a layer effect you can find it by pressing the \"FX\" button in the layer area of the timeline, then click on \"Add Effect\" in the dialog that appeared, and find your effect under the \"Loaded\" subcategory.
If your shader is using the `TIME` variable, it will not work well when loaded in Pixelorama. Instead, you can add a uniform named `PXO_time` (by adding `uniform float PXO_time;` as a line in the uniform area of your shader code), and replace all instances of `TIME` with `PXO_time`. `PXO_time` is a special uniform that measures the time in seconds passed every time a frame plays. For example, if your project runs at 5 frames per second, `PXO_time` will be equal to 0.2 (1 frame divided by 5 FPS is equal to 0.2 seconds, which is the time it takes for a single frame to play) when the second frame plays, if it has no custom delay. On the third frame it would be equal to 0.4, and so on. On the first frame, `PXO_time` is always equal to 0. `PXO_time` is also affected by the individual delay of each frame. By default, frames have no individual delay.
If you want to access the current frame index in your shader, you can use a uniform integer named `PXO_frame_index`. Similarly, you can use a uniform named `PXO_layer_index` to access the current layer index.
In the future, we plan to create a custom effect graph which will let users create effects directly within Pixelorama itself, and it will look and function similarly to Godot's Visual Shader editor.",
"import.md": "
In Pixelorama, it is possible to import [.pxo files](../concepts/project/#pxo-files), image files, [palette files](palettes) and [extension files](../extension_system/extension_basics). To import a file, either `drag and drop` it into Pixelorama window or use `File > Open` dialog. You can also open files in Pixelorama through the your computer's file explorer by right clicking on a file, selecting \"Open with\" and selecting Pixelorama, but the process of making this work is different for each operating system/desktop environment. Doing this will open Pixelorama with the file automatically opened. You can also achieve the same thing by opening Pixelorama through the command line, and giving the names of the files you want to open as arguments.",
"import.md/Import image options(1)": "
## Import image options
When attempting to import an image, a dialog will appear, containing a preview of the image you want to import, along with options that let you change how you want the image to be imported.
![Import image dialog](../../static/img/import_options_dialog.png)
These options include:
- New project, that lets you open the image as a new project
- Spritesheet (new project), that lets you open the image as a spritesheet in a new project. You can manually set the amount of horizontal and vertical frames, or select \"smart slice\", which attempts to figure out the amount of frames in the spritesheet automatically.
- Spritesheet (new layer). Same as above, but instead of opening the spritesheet in a new project, it opens it as a new layer in the currently active project.
- New frame, which opens the image as a new frame in the currently active project. You can specify which layer the new frame will belong to.
- Replace cel, which replaces a cel at the frame and the layer of your choosing, with the imported image in the currently active project.
- New layer, which opens the image as a new layer in the currently active project. You can specify in which frame the new layer will be at.
- New reference image, which opens the image as a reference image in the currently active project.
- New palette, which creates a new [palette](palettes) using the colors of the imported image.
- New brush, which opens the imported image as a [brush](../concepts/brush). You can choose whether the new brush will be a file brush, a project brush, or a random brush.
- New pattern, which opens the imported image as a pattern, which can be used by the bucket tool.
- Tileset, which can be used by [tilemap layers](tilemaps). You can manually set the amount of horizontal and vertical slices, or select \"smart slice\", which attempts to figure out the amount of frames in the spritesheet automatically.",
"import.md/Importing Aseprite files(4)": "
## Importing Aseprite files
Pixelorama can import Aseprite files, with the following features supported:
- Pixel, group & tilemap layers with their cels and preserved layer hierarchy (groups & children)
- Linked cels
- Layer blend modes, visibility/locked/collapsed, layer/cel opacity, layer name, color etc
- Projects with RGBA, Grayscale* and Indexed** color modes
- Frame tags
- Frame duration
- Tilesets
- Tilemap offset & cell transformations (rotation & flip)
- User data for projects, layers, frame tags & cels
Does not yet support:
- Palettes. Will be supported once we add project palettes in Pixelorama.
- Slices. Will be supported once we add slices (or a similar concept) in Pixelorama. Related: #812
- Cel extra, color profile, external files & mask.
\\* Aseprite projects with grayscale color mode are being converted to RGBA color mode when imported in Pixelorama, as Pixelorama does not support this color mode at the moment.
** While projects using indexed mode are being imported, their internal palettes are not, meaning that the colors will be different when importing the Aseprite file in Pixelorama, if the currently selected palette is different. To see the same colors, you need to bring the palette over from Aseprite into Pixelorama and select it. Once we add project palettes in Pixelorama (palettes that are being stored inside the project instead of being global), this will be fixed.",
"import.md/Importing multiple images(2)": "
## Importing multiple images
When importing multiple images at the same time, the import dialogs will also have an \"apply to all\" checkbox. When toggling this on in a dialog, the rest of the dialogs will hide and all of the imported images will share the same options. This way you can easily import multiple images as multiple projects, frames, layers, etc. The order that they are being imported is backwards, meaning that the the last image that you attempted to import, will be the first one that actually gets opened. For example, if you attempt to import image files named `1.png`, `2.png` and `3.png` in that order as new frames, the first frame would be image `3.png`, then `2.png` and then `1.png`.",
"import.md/Importing videos(3)": "
## Importing videos
It is also possible to import video and gif files, and Pixelorama will automatically import them as multiple frames. For this, you need [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/). All you have to do is download it if it's not already installed, and then find its executable path and copy it inside Pixelorama, in `Edit>Preferences>Startup>FFMPEG`. If you have FFMPEG in the PATH environment variable of your Operating System, you can just put \"`ffmpeg`\" in the text field in the Preferences, instead of copying the path.
:::caution Large files
Be careful not to import videos that are too big. Pixelorama is not yet optimized for importing large amount of frames which are common in videos, so it is possible that it will run out of memory and potentially crash.

The concept of internal extensions was origally targeted towards potentially making pixelorama more modular by grouping some of it's features into smaller extensions, but it can also be used in developing of extensions by users.
We will refer to our extension as \"Example\"",
"internal_extensions.md/Comparing the two methods(0)": "
## Comparing the two methods
        | Internal Extensions | Standard way (as separate project) |
        | --- | --- |
        | Both ways are easily interchangeable | Both ways are easily interchangeable |
        | During development you don't have to export a pck, every time you need to debug the extension | To debug you'd have to re-export your extension which is time consuming |
        | Pixelorama's source code is required | Creating the Extension project is required but Pixelorama's source code is optional |
        | You can extend pixelorama's classes (like BaseTool) | You can still extend classes, but Godot's code editor will complain (it's perfectly fine but it's not very pleasing to the eye) |",
"internal_extensions.md/Exporting an Internal Extension(2)": "
## Exporting an Internal Extension
When you are ready to release/distribute your extension to the public, you may choose one of the following ways.
### Converting an Internal Extension into an External one
These steps are basically the reverse of the steps mentioned in the previous section.
1. Make a new Godot project called \"Example\" (the **project name** is irrelevant but for simplicity we'll name it the same as our extension).
2. Remove/comment the line that was added to `res://src/HandleExtensions.gd` (In step 5 of [Making an Extension, internal](#making-an-extension-internal)). This step is not compulsory but is mentioned anyway for the sake of completeness.
3. From Pixelorama, move/cut your extension folder from `res://src/Extensions/Example`, To the `res://src/Extensions/Example` folder of your project (replacing existing files).
    ![Internal Extension File Structure](../../static/img/copy_extension_folder.png)
4. Now you can safely delete pixelorama's source code if you want (or use it for some other extension).
5. Export your extension, using steps from [this tutorial](./extension_basics#exporting-the-extension).
### Direct export of Internal Extension
Internal extensions can be exported directly instead of first converting it to an external extension.
1. Form the Godot editor, go to `Project -> Export...`.
2. In the Export dialog, add a new preset (any preset will work) and go to the Resources tab.
3. Write `*.json` in *'Filters to export non-resource files/folders'*. and in **Export Mode**, Choose *'Export selected resources (and dependencies)'* and select only your extension files as shown below.
    ![Internal Extension File Structure](../../static/img/export_internal_extension.png)
4. Press the `Export PCK/ZIP` button and export with the **same name as your extension**.",
"internal_extensions.md/Making an Internal Extension(1)": "
## Making an Internal Extension
:::tip converting external extension
The process for converting an **existing** external extension into an internal extension is almost the same as this. Instead of making files (step 3), you copy them over.
:::
1. Get and unzip the [source code](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/releases) of pixelorama that you intend to use for your extension.
2. Create an `Extensions` folder (case sensitive) in the pixelorama's source code inside the `res://src` folder.
3. Make the necessary files mentioned in step 2 of [this tutorial](./extension_basics#process). Your directory structure will resemble something like this
    ![Internal Extension File Structure](../../static/img/internal_extension_structure.png)
4. Navigate to the `res://src/Extensions/(extension name)/extension.json` file and copy the value of the `name` key. Then open `res://src/HandleExtensions.gd` file in pixelorama's source and find the `_add_internal_extensions()` method. Modify and save it as follows:
    ```
    func _add_internal_extensions() -> void:
        _load_extension(\"Example\", true)  # Add this line, and replace `Example` with the value of your `name` key.
    ```
Now the extension has become internal. From here you can continue to code in the `res://src/Extensions/<your extension>` folder of pixelorama (just don't create any files in outside your extension folder).
:::tip Accessing the API
In an internal extension, prefer using `ExtensionsApi` autoload directly instead of `get_node_or_null(\"/root/ExtensionsApi\")`

Welcome, fellow dreamer, to the documentation of Pixelorama: your free and open-source pixel-art creation tool, developed by Orama Interactive and our contributors. If you are new to this documentation, we recommend you start by learning [how to install the application](user_manual/installation), then reading the [User Interface Basics](user_manual/user_interface/user_interface_basics) page to familiarize yourself with Pixelorama's workspace. The ultimate goal of this program is to be able to keep up with the user's imagination and assist them in creating any kind of pixel art they wish. This could be a cool landscape, a dope animation, game graphics, random sketches or a well-thought pixelated meme. Thank you for researching our tool!
Here, you will understand the application's aspects, features, and tools from our tutorials. Eventually, you will be able to master it and apply it to your own pixelated goals. If you are an experienced pixel artist, familiar with most of Pixelorama's functionalities, you can search for some specific features and understand them better or get some ideas on how to creatively apply techniques you may not have thought of. In any case, fasten your seat belts because we are about to start!",

"layer.md": "
An artwork in Pixelorama can be consisted by several layers, giving you better control over different parts of the image, by allowing you to edit these parts without affecting any other part of the image. Layers are stacked on top of each other, which means that bottom layers are being drawn behind top layers. You can edit them in the [timeline](../user_manual/user_interface/timeline). Each layer consists of a [cels](cel), the number of which depends on the number of frames that the project has.",
"layer.md/Blend modes(1)": "
## Blend modes
The blend mode of each layer determines how its colors blend with the colors of the layer directly below it. Pixelorama supports the following blend modes:
| Name      | Category | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Passthrough | Normal | Only for group layers. Ignores group blending, like the group doesn't exist. |
| Normal | Normal | The blend layer colors are simply placed on top of the base colors. |
| Erase | Normal | Erases the non-transparent areas of the upper layer from the lower layer's alpha. |
| Darken | Darken | Keeps the darker colors between the blend and the base layers. |
| Multiply | Darken | Multiplies the numerical values of the two colors, giving a darker result. |
| Color burn | Darken | Darkens by increasing the contrast between the blend and base colors. |
| Linear burn | Darken | Darkens the base colors based on the value of the blend colors. |
| Lighten | Lighten | Keeps the lighter colors between the blend and the base layers. |
| Screen | Lighten | Lightens the colors by multiplying the inverse of the blend and base colors. |
| Color dodge | Lighten | Lightens by decreasing the contrast between the blend and base colors. |
| Add | Lighten | Lightens by adding the numerical values of the two colors. Also known as linear dodge. |
| Overlay | Contrast | Like Screen mode in bright base colors and Multiply mode in darker base colors. |
| Soft light | Contrast | Similar to Overlay, but more subtle. |
| Hard light | Contrast | Like Screen mode in bright blending colors and Multiply mode in darker colors. |
| Difference | Inversion | Subtracts the blend color from the base or vice versa, depending on the brightness. |
| Exclusion | Inversion | Similar to Difference mode, but with less contrast between the colors. |
| Subtract | Inversion | Darkens by subtracting the numerical values of the blend colors from the base. |
| Divide | Inversion | Divides the numerical values of the base colors by the blend. |
| Hue | Component | Uses the blend hue while preserving the base saturation and luminosity. |
| Saturation | Component | Uses the blend saturation while preserving the base hue and luminosity. |
| Color | Component | Uses the blend hue and saturation while preserving the base luminosity. |
| Luminosity | Component | Uses the blend luminosity while preserving the base hue and saturation. |",
"layer.md/Clipping mask(3)": "
## Clipping mask
Clipping masks can be used to draw the content of the layer only on top of the non-transparent pixels of the layer directly below. In other words, the layer below the clipping mask is what controls the visibility of the content of the clipping mask. You can make a layer be a clipping mask by right-clicking the layer button in the timeline, and toggling \"Clipping mask\".",
"layer.md/Layer effects(2)": "
## Layer effects
Layer effects are image effects that are being applied to the layer in a non-destructive way. This means that they do not directly modify the image data, which allows artists to disable and enable them at will, without having to worry that their work will be modified in a permanent way. They are only being applied on [export](../user_manual/save_and_export), and they can be previewed in the canvas, if \"Display Layer Effects\" is enabled, under the View menu. Each layer can contain multiple layer effects.
To add a layer effect, you can click on the \"FX\" button in the layer area of the timeline. A window will appear, that lets you add, remove and change the order of layer effects. You can also change the properties of each effect. For a list of all available layer effects, see [image effects](../user_manual/image_effects#list-of-image-effects).
:::info Layer vs image effects
The difference between layer effects and image effects, is that layer effects can only be **applied per-layer** and are **non-destructive**, while image effects can be applied to **multiple cels** at the same time, and are **destructive**. Also, as of right now, layer effects cannot be animated.
:::",
"layer.md/Types of layers(0)": "
## Types of layers
Right now, there are three types of layers. Pixel layers, group layers, and 3D layers.
### Pixel layers
Pixel layers are the default and most straight forward type of layer. Their cels contain regular raster image data, in which you can normally draw and manipulate pixels. Pixel cels are the only types of cels that can be linked right now.
### Group layers
Group layers are used mostly for organization and their cels are empty and do not hold any actual data. They can be used to group common layers together, and they can expanded and collapsed from view in the timeline. If their blend mode is set to something other than passthrough, they blend all of their children together, and they can be used as clipping masks, and by clipping masks.
### 3D layers
The cels of 3D layers contain 3D mesh, lighting, camera and environment data, that are being rasterized based on the size of the canvas. They can contain lights, such as directional lights, spot lights and point lights, and a variety of primitive meshes, including boxes, capsules, spheres, cylinders, prisms, toruses, planes and even text. Importing custom .obj models is also possible.
### Tilemap layers
Tilemap layers are a special type of pixel layer which use a tileset, and each cell of the grid has a reference to a tile from that tileset. See [the tilemaps page](../user_manual/tilemaps) for more information.
### Audio layers
Audio layers do not contain any visible data. Rather, as their name suggests, they contain audible data. More specifically, each audio layer contains an audio file, which can be played at any time during the animation. Users can load an audio file (only `.mp3` and `.wav` files are supported at the moment), and choose the frame they want the audio to start playing. Making an audio layer invisible essentially mutes the audio. Exporting a project file with audio layers as a video file will include the audio in the exported video.",
"palettes.md": "
Palettes are a way to organize colors in your projects.
Pixelorama ships on most platforms with two pre-made palettes (`Default` and `Pixelorama`). These palettes can be freely modified.
All palettes are physically stored on disk in Pixelorama data folder.

| Interaction | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `Left click` | Color will be left selected and set as the left tool color. |
| `Right click` | Color will be right selected and set as the right tool color. |
| `Double click` | Double click on an existing color opens a color picker to change it's color. |
:::tip palette grid panning
If palette size is greater than `8x8` it can be panned in the grid either with sliders or `Middle click + Mouse drag`.

### Tools {#palette-grid-tools}
Tools allow you to edit colors in the palette.
| Button | Tool | Description |
| -----  | ---- | ----------- |
| `+` | Add a new color | Left mouse click adds left tool color. Right mouse click adds right tool color. |
| `-` | Remove a selected color | Left mouse click removes left selected color. Right mouse click removes right selected color. |
| `↓` | Palette sorting options| A drop-down appears, containing the available sorting options. You can either apply the new color order directly to palette or to a copy of it. |
### Colors movement
Colors can be moved and copied around in the palette grid.
| Shortcut | Movement description |
| -------- | -------- |
| `Mouse drag` | Color switches with a color it is dropped on. |
| <kbd>Shift</kbd> + `Mouse drag` | Color is inserted where dropped. If dropped on another color the original color is moved to the right with every color next to it. |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + `Mouse drag` | Color is copied where dropped. If dropped on another color the original color is overwritten. |",
"palettes.md/Palettes import(2)": "
## Palettes import
To import a palette, either `drag and drop` a palette file into Pixelorama window or use `File > Open` dialog.
An imported palette will be converted to `Pixelorama palette`, stored physically in the Pixelorama data folder and added to the palettes selection in `Palettes panel`.
The only exception to import behavior is `Image palette`. Importing an image to Pixelorama will open `Import Options` dialog in which you can select `Import as > New palette` to process an image to import a palette.
:::tip palette extraction
You can import any image as a palette and extract colors from it. Every color from the image will be added to the palette only once. With bigger images, it can take longer time to finish.

:::caution file extensions
Palette format detection uses file extensions to determine how to parse palette formats. An incorrect extension will result in an import error.
:::
:::caution pre-1.0 pixelorama palettes
Palettes created in versions of Pixelorama prior to 1.0 cannot be reimported. The save format was changed from `.tres` to `.json`, due to security concerns. In order to convert an old palette to a new one, you can export it as an image from version 0.11.4, and import that image to the newest version.

"project.md": "
In Pixelorama, the term \"Project\" refers to the entire sprite, which contains all of the frames and layers it might have. Each project can be saved as a `.pxo` file. Multiple projects can be opened in Pixelorama at the same time, with each one having its own tab.
A project contains the following properties:
- The image data of each individual [cel](cel).
- The properties of the project itself, such as its name, size, FPS (frames per second) and [color mode](color_mode).
- All of the properties of frames, [layers](layer), cels, animation tags, [guides](../user_manual/user_interface/canvas/#rulers-and-guides).
- [Brushes](brush) that are local to that specific project.
- [Tilesets](../user_manual/tilemaps#tileset) that are used by [tilemap layers](../user_manual/tilemaps).",
"project.md/.pxo files(1)": "
## .pxo files
Pxo files are Pixelorama's custom file format that saves the entire content of the project. It cannot be opened in other image editors.
### File structure
The file format is essentially a .zip file in disguise. It contains a `data.json` file, and an `image_data` folder. The `data.json` file contains all of the project's metadata, such as project name, size, FPS, and the metadata of layers, frames, cels, etc. They are stored in JSON form, so they can easily be read by other software.
The `image_data` folder contains all of the image data. It contains another folder called `frames`, which in turn contains a folder for each `frame` of the project, and each frame folder contains the image data of every [cel](cel) that belongs to that frame. To preserve a non-destructive workflow, the cel image data are not affected by layer blend modes and layer effects. Along with the image data themselves, the data of the indices of each pixel are also being stored in the form of images. The files of these names start with `indices_`, and they are needed for [indexed mode](color_mode#indexed). 
If you have enabled the option to include the blended images, the `image_data` folder will also contain all of the final image data for each frame. A final image is composed of every cel, with the layer effects applied to each cel, blended together into a single image, taking the blend modes of each layer into account.
If the project has [brushes](brush), a `brushes` folder is also created, containing all of the brush image data. Similarly, if the project contains [tilemap layers](../user_manual/tilemaps), the tilesets that they use are being stored in a `tilesets` folder. Each tileset has its own folder, named after its index, and the folders contain the individual tiles in the form of image data. If the project contains audio layers, the audio files of these layers are being stored in an `audio` folder.
In order for a software to read the data of a pxo, it has to open it as a zip file, and then it has to read the `data.json` file, and parse it as JSON object. Then, it either has to loop through the all of the folders included in `image_data/frames`, where each folder contains the cel data for each frame separately, or, if the final blended images are included and that's all we care about, it just has to loop through all of the images inside the `image_data` folder, where each image corresponds to every frame of the project, and import them.
### Include blended images
During save, you are given the option to select if the blended images will be included in the exported file. If enabled, the final blended images are also being stored in the pxo, for each frame. This makes the pxo file larger and is useful for importing by third-party software or [CLI exporting](../user_manual/cli). Loading pxo files in Pixelorama does not need this option to be enabled.",
"project.md/Saving a project(0)": "
## Saving a project
See [this page](../user_manual/save_and_export/#saving) to learn how to save a project.",
"save_and_export.md": "
You can either save or export your projects. Saving a project will create a [.pxo file](../concepts/project/#pxo-files), which is Pixelorama's custom file format, while exporting means that one (or multiple, in case of animations) `.png`(s), an `.apng`, or a `.gif` file will be created.
:::tip saving vs exporting
Basically, you should **save** your project if you intend to use it again on Pixelorama and keep all of your data, such as layers, [project brushes](../concepts/brush/#project-brushes), animation tags, etc. While, if you want to share your artwork, import it in another software such as a game engine, or view it on an image editor, you should **export** it. Of course, nothing is stopping you from doing both, which is actually the recommended approach.
:::",
"save_and_export.md/Exporting(1)": "
## Exporting
To export your project, you can go to the File menu and select `Export...`, or press <kbd>Control + E</kbd>, and a window will appear. If you are using a Desktop version, you will be able to choose where you want the file to be saved. If you use the Web version, you will be asked for a file name and the `.png`, `.apng` or `.gif` file(s) will be downloaded by your browser.
Just like with save, you have to use the `Export as...` option or <kbd> Shift + Control + E</kbd> to export to a new directory.
You can choose what you want to export by clicking on one of the tabs on the top of the window.
:::tip resize while exporting
If you draw on a small canvas, the exported image will have a relatively slow resolution. Some software and websites tend to blur small images, which can make pixel art look bad. To avoid that, you are also given the option to resize on export, with a chosen interpolation method. This is useful when you want to share your art and make it easier for people to preview it. For most cases, sticking with the default Nearest interpolation should be fine.
:::
You can choose which frames you want to save by changing the \"Frame\" option below the preview. The default setting is to include all frames, but you can set it to only include the currently selected frame, or select specific tags. Similarly, you can select which layers you want to include by changing the \"Layers\" option. You are also given the option to select the animation direction from either forward, backward or a ping-pong loop.
### Export a sequence of images
![Export Images](../../static/img/export_images.png)
By default, the export window is set to export a sequence of images, one for each frame, either as multiple files, or as a single animated file, if the file format is set to an animated image format, such as `.gif` or `.apng`.
If you save your animation as multiple files, then every file will have a number attached to its name. For example, if the name is `filename.png`, the exported file names will be `filename_0001.png`, `filename_0002.png`, `filename_0003.png` and so on. In the advanced options, you can find options to change the separator character(s) (in the above example, the character is the underscore (`_`), which is also the default). If these frames also have a frame tag, the name of the tag can be included in the file name as well, by enabling \"Include frame tags in the file name\". You can also choose to automatically create a new directory for each frame tag for extra organization, by enabling \"Create new folder for each frame tag\". This will place all of the frames of the same tag in a different directory.
Keep in mind that if you are working with a large canvas size and/or multiple frames, the `.gif` exporting process can be slow. Until we speed up the process, it is recommended to export to `.apng` and use another tool, such as https://ezgif.com/apng-to-gif, to convert the `.apng` file to `.gif`.
### Export a spritesheet
![Export Spritesheet](../../static/img/export_spritesheet.png)
You can save the entire animation as a single image containing all of the frames. This is called a `spritesheet`. You can choose how many rows and columns you want your animation to be split into, in the spritesheet. Spritesheets can also be imported into Pixelorama.
![Exported Gif](../../static/img/exported_gif.gif)
##### The above project exported as a gif file with Pixelorama
### Export a video
You can also export to various video formats. The process is similar to [exporting a sequence of images](#export-a-sequence-of-images), but Pixelorama is not able to export to video by itself. For this, you need [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/). All you have to do is download it if it's not already installed, and then find its executable path and copy it inside Pixelorama, in `Edit>Preferences>Startup>FFMPEG`. If you have FFMPEG in the PATH environment variable of your Operating System, you can just put \"`ffmpeg`\" in the text field in the Preferences, instead of copying the path.",

## Selection Tools
You can use one of the available selection tools in Pixelorama. Each tool selects things slightly differently.
| Name      | Description | Default Shortcut |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Rectangular Selection | Create a rectangular selection.| L: <kbd>R</kbd>, R: <kbd> Alt + R</kbd> |
| Elliptical Selection | Create an elliptical selection. | L: <kbd>Y</kbd>, R: <kbd> Alt + Y</kbd> |
| Polygonal Selection | Create a polygonal selection. Click where you want each point of the polygon to be. Double click to end your polygon and finalize your selection area. | L: <kbd>K</kbd>, R: <kbd> Alt + K</kbd> |
| Select By Color | Selects all parts of the cel that share the same color.| L: <kbd>W</kbd>, R: <kbd> Alt + W</kbd> |
| Magic Wand | Selects the neighboring same-color area of the pixel the cursor was in on mouse button press. | L: <kbd>Q</kbd>, R: <kbd> Alt + Q</kbd> |
| Lasso / Free Select Tool | Selects a rough outline of an area. | L: <kbd>F</kbd>, R: <kbd> Alt + F</kbd> |
Similar to the [shape drawing tools](drawing), you can use keyboard shortcuts to modify how the rectangular and elliptical selections are being created.
- Mouse click + <kbd>Shift</kbd> = Create a 1:1 (square/circle) selection.
- Mouse click + <kbd>Control</kbd> = Create a selection that expands from the center.
- Mouse click + <kbd>Alt</kbd> = Displaces the origin of the selection.
You can also easily change the selection's position and size from the tool options if you have a selection tool pressed. Keep in mind that if there is an active transformation, the content inside the selected parts will be affected as well. Otherwise, these options only affect the selection itself and not its content.",
"shading.md": "
Pixelorama's shading tool can be used to easily add lighting and shadows to the artwork. You can use it the same way you use the [Pencil or Eraser tools](drawing), you mouse press on where the pixels of the sprite where you want to apply the shading. Similar to Pencil and Eraser, you can change the affected area size and brush. As of right now, there are two modes of shading, Simple Shading and Hue Shifting, which you can switch from the tool's options.",
"shading.md/Color Replace(2)": "
## Color Replace
This mode is pretty much self explanatory. The user selects an array of colors by first selecting a color on the palette and then specifying the number of colors to pick after it through the `Colors right` slider. When shading, if a color is present in the chosen array of colors, it then gets replaced by the next (or previous) color in the array, depending on your current lighten/darken mode.
![Color replace mode properties](../../static/img/shading_cr.png)
##### Properties of the Color replace shading mode.",
"shading.md/Hue Shifting(1)": "
## Hue Shifting
Hue Shifting is a bit more complex than Simple Shading. Instead of just shifting the `Value` of the color, we also shift their `Hue` and `Saturation` too. When we are brightening the colors, we shift their hue to move towards yellow (the limit is set to roughly 60 Hue), decrease their saturation and increase their value. On the contrary, when we are darkening the colors, their hue shifts towards blue (the limit is set to roughly 240 Hue), their saturation increases and their value decreases. This is all done automatically by the Shading tool, but you can also configure the amount the Hue, Saturation and Value change from the tool options.
Here is a video by Brandon James Greer that explains the concept of hue shifting.
<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PNtMAxYaGyg?si=zuahArZTx17avYvN\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>
:::caution hue shifting limits
The hue shifting mode does not always change the hue, saturation and value of the colors exactly as much as the values have been set by the user. For example, a color with a hue of 70 and the shading tool set to hue shifting, lighten and a hue of, let's say, 20, will not result in a color with a hue of 50 (because 70 - 20 = 50), but it will rather stay limited to 60, as this is the hard limit of lighting. Similarly, the hard hue limit of darkening is 240. If you want to exactly change the HSV values of a color, you can use the `Adjust Hue/Saturation/Value` image effect under the Image menu.
:::",
"shading.md/Simple Shading(0)": "
## Simple Shading
This is a fairly straightforward method of shading. You can choose to either lighten or darken the area where you clicked, as well as the shading value. The bigger the number, the more shading will be applied. All it does is simply increase (with lighting) or decrease (with shading) the `Value` of the pixel's colors, which represents the color's brightness. It essentially just makes the same colors brighter or darker.",

"tilemaps.md": "
It is possible to create tilemaps in Pixelorama, in the form of tilemap [layers](../concepts/layer). Tilemap layers are a special type of pixel layer which use a tileset, and each cell of the grid has a reference to a tile from that tileset. Tilemaps are usually used when designing levels for games.

You can create a new tilemap layer by going to the top left side of the timeline, and clicking on the first button's arrow. That will bring up a menu of all available layer types. From there, choose \"Tilemap layer\". A window will appear with an option to choose which tileset the tilemap will use. If you have already created tilesets in this project, you can choose to use those in your new tilemap layer. Otherwise, your only option will be to create a new tileset. When creating a new tileset, you can choose its name and the size of its individual tiles. Note that these **cannot** be changed later. It is possible, however, to change the tileset that the tilemap layer is using. To do that, you can right click on the tilemap layer in the timeline, select Properties, and choose a different tileset from the dropdown list. Note that this can be destructive if the new tileset has less tiles than the previous one.",
"tilemaps.md/Editing modes(3)": "
## Editing modes
Pixelorama offers two editing modes when using tilemap layers; Draw pixels and draw tiles. You can switch between them by clicking on the first button on the top left of the tiles panel, or by pressing <kbd>Shift + `</kbd>.
### Draw pixels
Draw pixels is the default mode, and is used to add/modify the tiles themselves, by drawing as you would on normal pixel layers. The draw pixels mode has three sub-modes, which can be toggled by the three buttons next to the draw tiles button, that are visible when draw pixels mode is active.
| Mode name      | Description | Default Shortcut |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Manual | This mode modifies individual tiles, and immediately applies the change to all other instances of the modified tile(s) in the tilemap. It does not affect the order of tiles in the tileset. | <kbd>Shift + 1</kbd> |
| Auto | The default mode. This mode creates new tiles in the tileset when drawing, if the modified tiles do not already exist in the tileset. If they do, the tiles get re-used. Tiles that are no longer used anywhere in the tilemap get erased from the tileset. | <kbd>Shift + 2</kbd> |
| Stack | This mode creates new tiles in the tileset every time a tile gets modified, without changing any of the already existing tiles. | <kbd>Shift + 3</kbd> |
### Draw tiles
The draw tiles mode is used to place tiles directly from the tileset to the tilemap, without modifying the content of the tileset. To draw tiles, you can select a tile from the panel, and then use the pencil tool to place it on the canvas. Tiles can only be placed in grid cells, and not between them. You can also quickly rotate and flip the tiles by clicking on the arrow buttons next to the draw tiles button, or by pressing <kbd>Shift + Z</kbd> to rotate left, <kbd>Shift + X</kbd> to rotate right, <kbd>Shift + C</kbd> to flip horizontally and <kbd>Shift + V</kbd> to flip vertically.
:::tip random tiles
You can select multiple tiles from the Tiles panel, either by holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> or <kbd>Control</kbd> while clicking on them, just like you can with the timeline layer/frame/cel buttons. If you have multiple tiles selected, Pixelorama will randomly choose one of the selected tiles to place when drawing. If you want to change the probability of individual tiles, you can right click on a tile, select Properties, and change the probability slider. By default, all tiles have their probability set to `1`, meaning that all of them have an equal chance to appear when drawing.
:::
When this mode is used, the behavior of most tools changes.
| Tools      | Behavior in draw tiles mode |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Pencil, bucket, line, curve and shape | Place tiles |
| Eraser | Remove tiles |
| Color picker | Quickly select a tile from the tilemap |
| Move | Moves the tilemap's offset along with its tiles |
| Selection | Select entire grid cells. Resizing a selection does not resize the pixels. Instead, it resizes the tile indices of the grid cells, placing more tiles if the selection is enlarged, or removing if it gets smaller. |
![A GIF of a tileset being resized with selection tools, using the draw tiles mode.](../../static/img/tileset_selection_resize.gif)",
"tilemaps.md/Tiles panel(2)": "
## Tiles panel
When a tilemap layer is selected, a new panel will appear in the user interface. From there, you can see all of the available tiles of the tileset, as well as some buttons that are related to the available editing modes.
:::caution panel not appearing
If the tiles panel does immediately become visible when switching to a tilemap layer, it has probably spawned as a tab next to the first available panel of the user interface, depending on your layout. If you are using a default layout, you can reset it by going to Window, Layouts, Reset. Otherwise, you will have to locate it by yourself and move it to the desired location manually.
:::",
"tilemaps.md/Tileset(0)": "
## Tileset
A tileset is essentially a collection of images of the same size, referred to as tiles. Each tile has an index number (a positive integer starting from 0), and they can be re-used multiple times, even in multiple tilemap layers, if they use the same tileset. Tilesets are created either automatically when creating a tilemap layer, or by [importing an image](import), and choosing to import it as a tileset. When saving a [project](../concepts/project), the tilesets are being stored inside the `.pxo` file. To see all of the available tilesets of a project, you can go to the Image menu and select Project Properties. From there, you can duplicate and delete tilesets. Note that you can only delete tilesets if they are not used by a tilemap layer.",
"timeline.md": "
The timeline's main purpose is to help you with creating animations. It is composed of frames, which are used for creating animations, and layers, which help you separate your frames in different parts. Each frame is essentially a collection of multiple layers, and each individual intersection of a frame and a layer is called a [cel](../../concepts/cel). All frames have the same amount of layers.
![Screenshot of Pixelorama's timeline](../../../static/img/timeline_cels.png)",
"timeline.md/Animation(0)": "
## Animation
To preview your animation, you can click on the `Play` button (or press <kbd>F5</kbd>) located on the top right side of the timeline. The button on the left (mapped to <kbd>F4</kbd>) is used to preview the animation backward.
### FPS
On the top and far right side of the timeline, you will see a number, which has the default value of 6. This is the FPS, which stands for `Frames Per Second`. To put it simply, this is the speed of the animation and it determines how many frames are being shown for every second. Having a value of 6 FPS, for example, will display 6 frames every second the animation is running.
For more details, you can read this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate).
### Loop modes
The button located directly on the left of the FPS is used to change the animation loop mode. There are three loop modes:
- Cycle loop. When the animation reaches the final frame, it will start playing again from the first frame. This is the default option.
- Ping-pong. When the animation reaches the final frame, it begins playing backward, starting from that final frame. When it reaches the first frame, it will again start playing forward until it reaches the final frame, and so on.
- No loop. When the animation reaches the final frame, it simply stops playing.
### Onion skinning
Directly on the left of the loop mode button, you will find two buttons used for onion skinning. Onion skinning is useful for animations because it's a simple and easy way to preview the previous and next frames at the same time as the frame you are currently editing. For more details, you can read this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_skinning).
The button on the right simply toggles onion skinning on and off, and the one on the left brings up options, like the amount of past (previous) and future (next) frames that appear, and blue-red mode, which tints the previous frames blue, and the next frames red.
:::tip ignore onion skinning
If you want a layer to ignore onion skinning simply add the \"_io\" suffix in its name.
:::",
"timeline.md/Cels(3)": "
## Cels
Cels are the intersection of layers and frames. For a more detailed explanation, you can [read this page](../../concepts/cel). To select a cel in order to draw on it, you can left-click on their respective button. The cel buttons take the most space in the timeline, and they are located to the right of the layer buttons and below the frame buttons. They also have a small preview of their image data on them.
Right-clicking on a cel button will bring up a menu, with options such as properties, link (or unlink) cel, and delete, which clears the content of the cel, making it fully transparent. In the cel properties, you can change their opacity (cel opacity is different than layer opacity), their z-index and also set custom user-defined data.
:::tip Selecting multiple cels
You can select/deselect multiple cels by holding the <kbd>Control</kbd> key and left-clicking individual cels, or hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key and left-click a cel to also select all of the cels between the one that was clicked and the one that has been selected last.
This also works on frame and layer buttons. For example, selecting two frame buttons using <kbd>Control</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd> will select all of their cels as well. The same is true for layer buttons.
:::
:::tip Drag and drop
You can drag and drop layer, frame and cel buttons to re-arrange them. Re-arranging frame and layer buttons also affects their cels.
:::",
"timeline.md/Frames(2)": "
## Frames
Directly above the cels, you will notice some buttons with each one having a number. These are the frame buttons, and the number they have is their order in the animation.
Clicking on a frame button will select that frame, and right-clicking a frame button will open up a menu. The menu options include frame properties, remove frame, clone frame, move frame to the left, move frame to the right, new tag, reverse frames (only works when multiple frames are selected), and center frames. Clicking on frame properties brings up a window that lets you change the duration of that frame, as well as set custom user-defined data.
:::tip frame duration
By default, the duration of each frame is set to 1x, which means it will take exactly as much time as the timeline FPS (frames per second). Setting it to 2x, for example, that frame will take twice as much time, while setting it to 0.5x will take half the time, meaning it will play out faster.
:::
You can also drag and drop frame buttons to re-arrange them. This will also affect their corresponding cels.
On the top side of the timeline, you will find frame-related buttons which offer the same functionality as the frame button right-click menu, like adding, removing, cloning and moving frames.
### Frame tags
Frame tags are used to organize different parts of your animated sprite. Those parts can also be exported independently using frame tags.
To create a new tag, you can right click on a frame button and select \"New Tag\". A popup will appear that lets you set a name for the tag, a color, the starting (from) and ending (to) frame, as well as custom user-defined data.
To edit an already existing tag, you can click on its name on the timeline, above the frame area. You can quickly move and resize it by dragging its edges.
If \"Animation plays only on frames of the same tag\" is toggled on in the timeline options, then, when you preview your animation, it will only preview the frames that belong on the same tag as the currently selected frame. This is a great way to preview parts of your animation separately.",
"timeline.md/Layers(1)": "
## Layers
On the left side of the timeline, you will see the layer buttons. Clicking on a layer button will select the current layer. Double-clicking will let you change the name of that layer. Right clicking a layer button will open up a menu, with options such as the layer's properties, and whether it's a clipping mask or not.
The layer buttons have three more buttons on them. The first toggles the layer's visibility. While invisible, the layer cannot be edited by the user. It will also remain invisible on export. The second locks and unlocks the layer. If the layer is locked, it cannot be edited by the user, but it does remain visible. The third button is used to automatically link the new cels that are being created. If it's toggled on, it is essentially a fast way to create linked cels.
There are 7 more buttons located on top of the layers. These, in order of appearance: add a new layer, remove the currently active layer, move the current layer up and down, clone the current layer, merge the current layer with the one directly below it, and open up a dialog for layer effects. Below these buttons, you can change the selected layer's blend mode and opacity.",

## Left and right mouse buttons
:::tip tools for left and right mouse buttons
Left-clicking a tool will assign this tool to your left mouse button and right-clicking it will assign the tool you clicked to your right mouse button. If you left-click on the canvas, your left tool will be activated, and if you right-click on the canvas, your right tool will be activated.
:::
In Pixelorama, you are given the ability to map a different tool to each mouse button, left and right. This essentially means that you can use a different tool with your left mouse button, and a different tool with your right mouse button. The two mouse buttons can be used **independently** of one another. In the toolbar, you will see one of the tool buttons having a half background on the left side of the button as **blue**. This represents the left mouse button, and it means that this specific tool has been **mapped to the left mouse button**. Similarly, the tool button with that has has a half background on the right side as **orange is mapped to the right mouse button**. If a tool button has both a blue and orange background, then this means that this tool has been mapped to both left and right mouse buttons.
So, to sum up, blue represents the left mouse button and orange represents the right mouse button. To map a tool to your left mouse button you can left-click the button of the tool you want to map in the toolbar, and to map a tool to your right mouse button you can right-click the tool button.
When you are on your [canvas](user_interface/canvas), if you left-click, the tool that you left-clicked on the toolbar will be used and if you right-click, the tool that you right-clicked will be used.

## Tool options
Almost every tool has certain properties that the user can tweak, such as brush type and size, different modes, color or mirroring. The tool options are located in the right side of the application window and they are separated in left tool and right tool settings. These, of course, correspond to the two tools you have mapped at your two mouse buttons. The two colors are also mapped to different mouse buttons. The left one is for the left mouse button tool, and the right one is for the right mouse button tool.
:::note Change mode quickly!
Most of the tools have some binary property that has to be changed often. Holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> will allow you to quickly alternate between the properties for a given tool as follows:

"transforming.md": "
Currently, there are three types of transformations in Pixelorama. Translation (moving), scale and rotation. Transformations can either affect the currently active entire cels, or [selections](selecting).
Keep in mind that **any content moved outside the canvas boundaries will be lost**.",
"transforming.md/Having An Active Transformation(3)": "
## Having An Active Transformation
When moving or scaling a selection with its contents, the selected pixels will suddenly become transparent. This indicates that a selection transformation has started. This means that your changes haven't yet been applied to the image. When there is an active transformation, moving and scaling will only affect the transformed content and nothing else, until it is applied.
### Applying A Transformation
To apply your changes, you can either press <kbd>Enter</kbd>, or by doing any other action, such as drawing, applying an image effect, selecting another cel, adding a new frame or layer, etc. Doing any of these will automatically apply your changes.
### Canceling A Transformation
To cancel a transformation, you can either press <kbd>Escape</kbd> or undo. You will not be able to redo your actions if you decide to cancel.",
"transforming.md/Move(0)": "
## Move
To move pixels around in the canvas, you can use the Move tool. It works by simply holding the mapped mouse button and dragging the cursor to where you want to move the content. If there is no active selection, it will move the entire content of the active cels. If there is a selection, it will start a selection transformation, and it will move both the selection itself and its content. To move a selection, it is also possible to use a selection tool and click inside the selected area and, while the mapped mouse button is being held, drag the cursor, just like you do with the Move tool. There are some keyboard shortcuts that can help you with movement. **The order of the key press and mouse button press matters for the selection tools.**
- Mouse movement + <kbd>Shift</kbd> = Moves & snaps selection to an axis.
- Mouse movement + <kbd>Control</kbd> = Moves & snaps selection to the rectangular grid.
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + Mouse movement = Moves selection without content. **This only works for the selection tools and not the Move tool.**
- <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + mouse movement = Copies selection and moves it without cutting it from the original position. This is basically a quick way to copy and move stuff around without <kbd>Control + C</kbd> and <kbd>Control + V</kbd>. **This only works for the selection tools and not the Move tool.**
If you have a selection tool active, you can also use the arrow keys to move the selection and contents. Pressing <kbd>Alt</kbd> only moves the selection without content, and holding <kbd>Control</kbd> moves the selection by the size of the rectangular grid tiles. You can also manually change the position of the selection from the tool options. If there is an active transformation, the content will be affected as well, otherwise, it will only move the selection itself without its content.",

To rotate your image, you can go to the Image menu and select Rotate Image. There, you can choose one of the three rotation algorithms. You can experiment with every one of them to see what works best for you. You are also given the option to only affect the selected part of the image or the entire area of the active cels. In the future, there will most likely be gizmos that rotate the selection directly, just like there are for scaling.",
"transforming.md/Scale(1)": "
## Scale
To resize your image, you can go to the Image menu and select **Scale Image**. There you can choose the new size of your entire [project](../concepts/project). You can also just expand the canvas without affecting the content that is inside by going to the Image menu and pressing **Resize Canvas**. Furthermore, you can go to Image -> Crop Image, which will remove all of the transparent pixels that surround your drawing, by shrinking the size of the image. Of course, all of these options will affect all of the cels of the project.
If you want you resize only selected part(s) of your artwork, you can create a [selection](selecting) and use one of the eight gizmos that appear on each side of the selection borders. To use them, you can simply left-click on them, hold, then move your cursor. Moving it outwards will expand the size, while moving it inwards will shrink it. Using gizmos will start a selection transformation. Like with movement, there are some keyboard shortcuts you can use to give you more control over the transformation.
- Mouse click + <kbd>Shift</kbd> = Keeps the original aspect ratio of the selection.
- Mouse click + <kbd>Control</kbd> = Expands from the center.
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + Mouse click = Only affects the selection and not the content.
You can also manually change the size of the selection from the tool options. If there is an active transformation, the content will be affected as well, otherwise, it will only scale the selection itself without its content.",

## Error code 12 when exporting png files
![Error code 12](../static/img/error_code_12.png)
This error has only been spotted in the Windows platform. Sometimes, when exporting png files, the process may fail due to \"Error code 12\". This most likely happens when you try to export in a directory that is protected by **anti-virus software**. To resolve it, you can try tweaking the settings of your anti-virus to either whitelist Pixelorama or disable folder protection. We can't guarantee that this will work, as it also depends on what anti-virus software you are using. Alternatively, you can export in a directory that is not protected by the anti-virus.
It is also possible that this issue may be solved if you run Pixelorama as an administrator.
If neither of these works, you could save your projects as a pxo file, open the Web version, drag and drop the pxo file there, and export the png file from the Web version.",

## I have a hiDPI monitor and the User Interface is very small!
It is possible to change the scale of the UI, by going to the Edit menu, selecting Preferences and going to the Interface tab. There, you can change the display scale, which goes from 1 (smallest) to 4 (biggest). 4 essentially means that the UI will be 4 times bigger than the default UI. Then, you click Apply to set the changes. Keep in mind that it's best to use integer values, such as 1, 2, 3 and 4, otherwise the UI may appear blurry.",

## I have performance issues, Pixelorama is very slow on my machine
We are doing our best to optimize the performance. That being said, you can improve the performance of the app significantly by trying the following:
- Change the **app's** maximum framerate, in order to reduce CPU usage. To do that, you can go to the Edit menu, Preferences and then click the Performance tab. There, you can set a maximum value for the FPS in \"Set application FPS limit:\". Keep in mind that the lower the number, the lower the CPU usage, but the application gets slower, choppier and unresponsive, so make sure not to set it *too low*. 0 means that there is no limit.
- If you have any group layers, try setting their blend mode to \"Passthrough\".
If you have a specific performance issue you'd like us to look at, feel free to [open an issue on Pixelorama's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues).",

You are saving instead of exporting. Saving creates pxo files, which are Pixelorama's custom file format for [projects](concepts/project).

## Pixelorama crashed while I was working on my project!
Crashes are unfortunate, and while we are doing our best to fix them, some issues causing the application to crash may have escaped our grasp. The good news is that you can enable **automatic backups**, that save your work every a certain time interval. You can enable them from the Edit menu, Preferences, Backup and then by ticking on \"Enable autosave\".
![Enable Autosave](../static/img/enable_autosave.png)
Besides that, it is **strongly recommended** that you save often, and keep copies of your files as backups in case something gets lost.
You can also aid us in our fight against crashes by [reporting issues on GitHub](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues) and uploading the content of Pixelorama's log files. You can find the log files in `C:\\Users\\[USERNAME]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Pixelorama\\logs` on Windows, `~/.local/share/Pixelorama/logs` on Linux and `/Users/[USERNAME]/Library/Application Support/Pixelorama/logs` for macOS. It is also extremely helpful, if not necessary, to be as specific as possible with the steps that led to the crash. By giving us specific steps to reproduce the issue, we can solve it faster.",

## Some things stopped working after the update!
After updating pixelorama, if some things like tools or effects stop working, some extension may be causing this behavior due to some file conflicts, try to update your extensions as soon as possible or uninstall them if there is none (Disabling the extension won't fix it). ",

## macOS says that Pixelorama is damaged!
![Damaged App](../static/img/damaged_app.png)
You may encounter some errors saying that Pixelorama is damaged. This is because the latest versions of MacOS mark the launcher of unknown binaries as a non-executable file. This most likely has to do with the fact that Pixelorama is not signed.

"user_interface_basics.md": "
Pixelorama aims for a simplistic and understandable, yet professional User Interface (from now on referred as \"UI\"). Optimized for quick access to everything, Pixelorama's UI looks like this:
![A screenshot of Pixelorama's UI which has been edited to have its interface numbered.](../../../static/img/ui-introduction.png)
##### A screenshot of Pixelorama's UI which has been edited to have its interface numbered. Note that the image above is the default look of Pixelorama (using the default dark theme), right after you have closed the splash screen.
Now, let's categorize the common elements of which the UI is consisted of and give everything a short description.
- **1** - The traditional top bar with menus found in most windowed applications.
- **2** - The [toolbar](../tools). The area where you can select a tool to work with.
- **3** - The [canvas](canvas) area. Located in the middle of your view, the canvas is the \"sheet\" on which you are creating your artwork. This is the main area of the workspace because this is where you will be doing all of the drawing. On the top side you will also find the project tabs, where all of your currently opened projects are. You can switch between them by clicking on their respective tab.
- **4** - The [timeline](timeline). This is where you will find the projects's layers and frames for animation.
- **5** - The global tool options, which contain some settings such as mirroring, pixel perfect, alpha lock and dynamics that are being shared between both the left and the right tool.
- **6** - The color picker, where you can change the colors of the left and right tools.
- **7** - The [tool options](../tools/#tool-options). This is where you can configure some settings of your currently active tools.
- **8** - The [palettes](../palettes). Useful for easily picking pre-set colors.
:::tip Hidden panels
There are even more panels in Pixelorama, but they are hidden by default. To make them visible, you can go to the top bar menu, select Window, Panels, and toggle on the panels you wish to make visible. You can hide them by toggling them off the same way.
:::",
"user_interface_basics.md/Changing the look of the interface(0)": "
## Changing the look of the interface
By default, the dark theme is enabled on Pixelorama. You can select another by going to the Edit menu on the top bar, selecting Preferences and clicking on the `Interface` tab on the left. There, you can also change other settings, such as the display scale of the entire interface and the font that the text of the interface uses, as well as its size.",
"user_interface_basics.md/Floating windows(2)": "
## Floating windows
If the tabs of the panels are visible, on the right side of the tab area, there will be a small options button. Clicking on that, a menu appears with the option make the panel into a floating window. Closing that floating window will turn it back into a panel. By default, these windows will be embedded into Pixelorama's main window. If you want them to be able to go outside the main window and act as native windows of your operating system, you can go to the Edit menu, Preferences, and under the Interface category, toggle \"Single window mode\" off, and then restart Pixelorama.",
"user_interface_basics.md/UI customization(1)": "
## UI customization
The user interface of Pixelorama is very customizable, allowing you to re-arrange the panels however you want. To move a panel, you have to enable \"Moveable Panels\" from the Window menu (or press F9, which is its default shortcut). This will make each panel have their own tab. Click with your left mouse button (or touch, if you are using a touch screen) on the tab of the panel you wish to move, and drag it to the area you want to move it to. A highlight will appear while dragging, which lets you know of the space the panel will take once you finish dragging. Release your mouse button (or your finger) to move the panel to its new position.",
"user_interface_basics.md/UI layouts(3)": "
## UI layouts
You also have the ability to make custom layouts of the user interface. You can change the layout by going to the Window menu, and selecting a layout from the Layouts submenu. If you want to save the current state of the UI as a layout, you can go to the Window menu, and, under Layouts, select \"Add Layout\", and a new layout will be saved. To delete a layout, select it and then click on the \"Delete\" option. To restore a default layout to its original state, select it and click on the \"Reset\" option. Note that this only works for default layouts, not user-made ones."
