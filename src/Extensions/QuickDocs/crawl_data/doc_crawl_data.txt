## Brush Types
Pixelorama comes with three default brushes, the usual pixel/square brush, a hollow circle and a filled circle brush. These brushes are based on algorithms, while all of the other brushes as of right now are based on image data. The main difference is that the image-based brushes are scaled the same way that images are being scaled, which may not always have the result we desire. The image-based brushes are also divided into two types, File brushes and Project brushes. File brushes are stored as external `.png` files, while project brushes are stored in the [project](project) itself. File brushes can also be Random brushes. Each time you draw using a random brush, the result will be something different!
Image-based brushes will also have one extra option in the tool settings; a \"Brush Color From\" slider which goes from 0 to 100. If it's set to 0, the resulting color(s) of the brush will come entirely from the image data themselves. Otherwise, if set to 100, the brush color will come from the currently selected color. This setting is important to have because, since image-based brushes rely on image data, this means that they also get to keep the original colors of the image data.",
"brush.md/Making Your Own Custom Brushes(1)": "
## Making Your Own Custom Brushes
### File Brushes
Pixelorama gives you the option to create your own custom brushes, which you can later use to draw. There are two brush types, File and Project brushes. File brushes are `.png` files saved in the `pixelorama_data/Brushes` directory. They are available for all projects. To create a \"File\" custom brush, all you need to do is create your brush and save it as a `.png` file in the `pixelorama_data/Brushes` directory. They will be found on the \"File\" tab.
![File brushes tab](../../static/img/file_brushes.png)
### Random Brushes
To make a random brush, save your sprites as multiple `.png` files, with `\"~\"` at the beginning of their filename, and save them in the same sub-directory. For example, if you want to save a grass random brush, you can create a `pixelorama_data/Brushes/Grass` directory, and name the files something like `~Grass1.png`, `~Grass2.png`, `~Grass3.png`, `~Grass4.png`, and so on. The more files you add, the more variation (random values) your random brush will have.
![Random brush files](../../static/img/grass_random_brush.png)
### Project Brushes
Project brushes are project-dependent, which means that they're not available for all projects. They are saved inside `.pxo` files. To create a Project brush you can [select](../user_manual/selecting) the part of the drawing you want to save as brush, and press <kbd>Control + B</kbd> or go to Edit, New Brush. They will be found on the \"Project\" tab.
![Project brushes tab](../../static/img/project_brushes.png)",
"canvas.md": "
![Pixelorama's Canvas](../../../static/img/canvas.png)
The canvas is the area where your drawing is located and it's also where you apply all of the tools at your disposal. While you can scroll around the canvas without limits, you cannot draw outside the canvas's boundaries, which are set by the size of the image. Of course, you can always resize the project to expand or shrink your canvas's limits.",
"canvas.md/Grid(1)": "
## Grid
The grid is an important tool that aids the user in accurately drawing lines. Currently, Pixelorama has two types of grids, rectangular and isometric. The rectangular grid is what you will probably use most of the time, while the isometric grid is great if you are making isometric art, like the one pictured below.
![Isometric Grid](../../../static/img/canvas_isometric_grid.png)
### Editing the Grid
The grid's properties can be edited in the Preferences, which is found under the Edit menu, and then selecting \"Canvas\" on the left side. The option includes the grid type itself (rectangular, isometric or both), the width and height of the rectangular grid, the width and height of the isometric bounds of the cells, the x and y offset of the grid, the grid color and whether to draw over Tile Mode.
To toggle its visibility, you can click on \"Show Grid\" in the View menu, or by pressing <kbd>Control + G</kbd>.
### Pixel Grid
The Pixel Grid is a rectangular 1x1 grid that appears after a certain zoom level. You can change its color and after which zoom level it appears at the same place as the rest of the grid options.
To toggle its visibility, you can click on \"Show Pixel Grid\" in the View menu, or by pressing <kbd>Control + H</kbd>.",
"canvas.md/Navigation(0)": "
## Navigation
You can navigate around the canvas in multiple ways.
### Zoom
To zoom, you can use the mouse wheel. Scroll the wheel up to zoom in, and down to zoom out. You can also use <kbd>+</kbd> on your keyboard to zoom in and <kbd>-</kbd> to zoom out. You can see the current zoom level of the canvas in the top bar of the user interface.
There is also a dedicated zoom tool, which you can use like any other tool, by pressing either the left or the right mouse button, depending on where you mapped it. The zoom tool can prove useful for users with no mouse, such as graphics tablet or touch screen users. From the tool's options, you can switch it to either zoom in or out, and you can also find two buttons.
![Zoom tool options](../../../static/img/tooloptions_zoom.png)
The first one is \"Fit to frame\" which basically centers your canvas and makes it as big as possible without any portion of it not being visible.
The second one is 100% zoom. This basically makes the canvas its exact pixel dimensions based on your screen. For example, if your canvas is 64x64 pixels, pressing this button will make the canvas appear on a 64x64 area of your screen. This gives you an idea of how your art looks at its original dimensions.
### Pan
You can pan by either holding the middle mouse button or <kbd>Space</kbd> on your keyboard and simply moving the mouse. You can also use the arrow keys to move around. Like with zoom, there is also a dedicated pan tool.
### Mirror
You can mirror your view horizontally and non-destructively by going to the View menu and clicking \"Mirror View\", or by pressing <kbd>Shift + M</kbd>.",
"canvas.md/Rulers and Guides(4)": "
## Rulers and Guides
On the top and left sides of the canvas, you can find two rulers. These serve two purposes, the first is to let the user easily and effortlessly measure distances in pixels, and the second is to create guides by clicking on them with the left mouse button and, while it's being held, dragging the cursor to the position you want your guide to be at. Guides are either horizontal or vertical lines that can be used as references to help you properly align stuff on your canvas.
### Editing Guides
To move an already created guide, you can drag the guide by clicking and holding the left mouse button while your cursor is pointing at the guide but it's also **outside the canvas boundaries**. If it's not, it will simply apply your currently selected tool. If the guide is completely moved outside the canvas area, it will be removed.
You can also change their colors by going to Edit, Preferences, Canvas.
### Toggling Visibility
You can also easily hide the rulers and the guides from the View menu. <kbd>Control + R</kbd> toggles the visibility of the rulers, and <kbd>Control + F</kbd> toggles the visibility of the guides.",
"canvas.md/Second Canvas(3)": "
## Second Canvas
On the right side of the canvas, there is a grabber. Moving it to the left will reveal a second canvas. The purpose of this is to easily preview your artwork in different positions or zoom levels. As of right now, you **cannot** draw on it.",
"canvas.md/Tile Mode(2)": "
## Tile Mode
If you are working with tiles, it might be useful to preview them in such a way so you can see if they repeat seamlessly. For this reason, you can enable Tile Mode, which repeats the canvas in multiple dimensions around the central area. To enable Tile Mode, you can go to the View menu, hover on Tile Mode and select what you want. \"None\" will disable Tile Mode, \"Tiled in Both Axis\" will repeat the canvas horizontally, vertically and diagonally, and the other two options will just repeat it either horizontally or vertically. It is also possible to draw in the tiled area.",
"canvas.md/Transparent Background(5)": "
## Transparent Background
If you are working with a drawing that has transparent pixels, a checkerboard background will appear there. Its purpose is to simply show that these areas are transparent. The background itself is **not part of your drawing**. Meaning, it will not be exported along with the final image.
### Editing the transparent background
You can edit the checkerboard background by going to the Edit menu, Preferences, and selecting Canvas. The options include the size of the checkers in pixels, the two colors that make up the checkerboard, and whether they follow the canvas movement and zoom level. If both \"Follow Canvas Movement\" and \"Follow Canvas Zoom Level\" are toggled on, the checkerboard matches exactly the pixels of the canvas that you draw and will pretty much act as a second grid.",
"cel.md": "
In Pixelorama, the term \"Cel\" (from [celluloid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cel)) refers to the intersection of frames and layers of the project. Basically, every frame in a project has as many cels as there are layers. You could think of frames as a collection of cels, for every layer. So for example, if the project has 3 frames and 4 layers, each frame would have 4 cels, making the total cels 3 x 4 = 12.
![Timeline Cels](../../static/img/timeline_cels.png)
Cels can be found in the timeline. They are the square buttons you can click to edit. You can select/deselect multiple by holding the <kbd>Control</kbd> key and left-clicking individual cels, or hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key and left-click a cel to also select all of the cels between the one that was clicked and the one that has been selected last.",
"cel.md/Linked cels(0)": "
## Linked cels
You can also right-click cels, that belong to a pixel layer, to link them together. Linked cels share the same image data, meaning that if you make changes to one linked cel, the changes are shared with all other linked cels. Keep in mind that, as of right now, linked cels are layer-local. You cannot have cels linked that belong to different layers, only different frames. Linked cels are marked with a colored rectangle behind their preview.",
"cel.md/Z-Index(1)": "
## Z-Index
Z-index can be edited through the cel properties, and it is used to change the ordering of individual cels independently of the layer they are in, making them appear behind, or in front of other cels in different layers. The default value of 0 means that the cel's ordering is the same as its layer's. Positive values move it to the front, and negative values move it to the back.",
"cli.md": "
Pixelorama offers a Command Line Interface (CLI), allowing you to use some of its features, such as project [exporting](save_and_export), from the command line. The CLI can be used to automate tasks easily. It can only be used on desktop platforms, such as Windows, Linux and macOS.",
"cli.md/Options(0)": "
## Options

"drawing.md": "
Drawing is the main feature of Pixelorama and it's what you will be doing most of the time. There are multiple tools that can be used for drawing in the [canvas](user_interface/canvas), with the main one being the **Pencil** tool.",
"drawing.md/Bucket(2)": "
## Bucket
The bucket tool is a quick way to paint large sections of the image. You can select one of two fill areas. \"Same color area\" will fill the area around the mouse click position that is the same color as the pixel on mouse position with the selected color, using a [flood fill algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill). \"Same color pixels\" will change all of the pixels of the selected [cels](../concepts/cel) of the same color as the one on mouse position with the selected color.
You can also choose to fill with patterns instead of a color.",
"drawing.md/Color Picker(4)": "
## Color Picker
This one is fairly simple to comprehend. While not a drawing tool itself, the color picker tool is used for getting a sample of an existing color on the canvas with the purpose of replicating it, depending on which pixel the selection is done at.
Now, there's only one category available as an option for the time being, called \"Pick for:\". This means that the sample taken will replace one of the colors, either the **Left Color** or **Right Color**. Choosing **Left Color** replaces the left selected color, while right replaces the right selected color.
:::tip Quick access
You can quickly access the color picker **without changing tools** by simply holding <kbd>Alt</kbd> and <kbd>Left/Right Click</kbd> the desired color to assign it to Left or Right tools respectively.
:::
:::tip Quick access
Another quick and helpful way to use the color picker is having it mapped to your **right mouse button** and having the **Left Color** option selected while having a drawing tool mapped to your **left mouse button.** The color picker can complement the drawing tool by selecting the color you next desire to paint with, making it an immediate way of switching between hues.

## Drawing Tools
You can use one of the available drawing tools in Pixelorama to bring your heart's content to life.
| Name      | Description | Default Shortcut |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Pencil | Draw individual pixels on mouse position.| L: <kbd>P</kbd>, R: <kbd> Alt + P</kbd> |
| Bucket | Fill a same-color area or all of the pixels of the same color with a new color. | L: <kbd>B</kbd>, R: <kbd> Alt + B</kbd> |
| Line Tool | Create a straight line. | L: <kbd>L</kbd>, R: <kbd> Alt + L</kbd> |

| Ellipse Tool | Create an ellipse. | L: <kbd>C</kbd>, R: <kbd> Alt + C</kbd> |
Tools that are not used directly for drawing but are very helpful for your drawing process:
| Name      | Description | Default Shortcut |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Color Picker | Get the color of the pixel on mouse position. | L: <kbd>O</kbd>, R: <kbd> Alt + O</kbd> |

"drawing.md/Mirroring(5)": "
## Mirroring
All drawing tools can work with symmetry. Symmetry in Pixelorama is either horizontal, vertical or both at the same time. It can be enabled from the tool options. If, for example, horizontal symmetry is enabled, whatever you draw will get mirrored, meaning it will also get drawn on the other horizontal side, having the same distance from the symmetry line as your original drawing. So if you draw a pixel two pixels from the left of the vertical symmetry line and horizontal symmetry is enabled, then the pixel two pixels from the right of the symmetry line and on the same vertical position will also get drawn. The same holds true when vertical symmetry is enabled.
If you have both horizontal and vertical mirroring enabled, then the drawn pixels will get repeated four times.",
"drawing.md/Pencil and Eraser(1)": "
## Pencil and Eraser
The main tools of Pixelorama. Used to draw or erase pixels at an individual pixel level. You can select from multiple [brushes](../concepts/brush) and change their size. You can also hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> before drawing to create lines between two points, and by also holding <kbd>Control</kbd>, you constrain them either by 15 degrees, or always making them be pixel-perfect angles by having the \"Pixel Perfect\" option enabled.
The eraser erases pixels by simply subtracting their color RGBA value by the given opacity value. If the opacity value is 255 then the color RGBA value becomes (0, 0, 0 ,0), which is equivalent to black that is completely transparent.
### Pencil Tool Options
The Pencil tool also has an \"Overwrite Color\" tool option. If this is enabled, the color of the drawn pixels will always become the same color as the selected one. Otherwise, if the colors are transparent, their alpha values will blend. For example, if the color of the drawn pixels have are 30% transparent and your currently selected color is 25% transparent, the resulting transparency will be 55%. While if the overwrite color option is on, the resulting transparency will always be 25%.
The \"Fill inside\" option fills the entire area with the selected color between the first mouse-clicked position and the last, after the mouse button gets released.
### Pixel Perfect
The Pencil and Eraser (and [Shading](shading)!) tools have an option called \"Pixel Perfect\". This essentially creates \"pixel perfect\" lines for you by automatically removing the middle pixel of L-shapes. In other words, it removes extra adjacent pixels often referred to as \"doubles\" in order to create lines that are one-pixel thick.
![Not pixel-perfect line vs pixel perfect line](../../static/img/pixel_perfect_line_diff.png)
##### Not pixel-perfect line on the left, compared to a pixel perfect line on the right.",
"drawing.md/Shape tools(3)": "
## Shape tools
The shape tools include the line tool, rectangle tool and ellipse tool. All of them are very straightforward to use; you click on where you want to place your shape, hold your mouse button and finally release it on where you want your shape to end. You can also change the shape's thickness, and for the rectangle and ellipse tools, you can choose whether to create hollow or filled with color shapes.
Similar to the [selection tools](selection), you can use keyboard shortcuts to modify how the shapes are being created.
- Mouse click + <kbd>Shift</kbd> = Create a 1:1 (square/circle) shape. For the line tool, <kbd> Shift</kbd> will restrain the angle to be pixel perfect, similar to how <kbd>Control</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> do for the Pencil tool.
- Mouse click + <kbd>Control</kbd> = Create a shape that expands from the center.
- Mouse click + <kbd>Alt</kbd> = Displaces the origin of the shape.",

To start debugging, **run pixelorama through godot** and follow the steps mentioned in [Installing the Extension](#installing-the-extension). The debug messages for the extension will appear in the Godot instance that's running the Pixelorama's source-code.

1. From the top bar in Godot editor go to **Project > Export** and choose any platform option (the extension should work on other platforms regardless of which platform you choose).
2. In then go to the **Resources** tab and do the following changes;
   - **Export Mode** should be set to `Export all resources in the project`
   - **Filters to export non-resource files/folders** should be set to `*.json`
   - **Filters to exclude files/folders from project** can remain empty.

## Making an Extension
Since **Pixelorama v0.10**, you can add/remove extensions to/from Pixelorama. Extensions are distributed as PCK (.pck) or ZIP (.zip) files and you can manage them from **Edit > Preferences > Extensions**. This is a step-by-step guide of how you can make an extension for Pixelorama. For this tutorial the extension we'll make will be called \"Example\" 
### Prerequisites
First of all, there are a few prerequisites for you to start creating extensions.
- Some knowledge of GdScript.
- A ready to use [Godot executable](https://godotengine.org/) (See the [Pixelorama Channgelog](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) to figure out which version to use).
- [Source code](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/releases) for your target version of Pixelorama (This is optional but will speed up your debugging workflow).
### Process
:::tip version control
To ensure your work isn't accidentally lost, it is highly recommended that you use version control (e.g Git) in your extension project. 
:::
1. First of all make a new Godot project of name \"Example\" (the project name is irrelevant but for simplicity we'll name it the same as our extension).
2. After that make a directory structure as shown in the image below.
![Extension File Structure](../../static/img/extension_structure.png)
##### The File Structure of any basic extension.
In the \"Example\" folder you can see three files;
- extension.json
- Main.tscn
- Main.gd
These files are the bare minimum required for an extension to function properly. Let's go through each of them one by one:
### extension.json
The `extension.json` file serves as a basic configuration file for the extension. A proper `extension.json` file should contain the below content
```
{
    \"name\": \"Example\",
    \"display_name\": \"Anything you want\",
    \"description\": \"What the extension does\",
    \"author\": \"Your Name\",
    \"version\": \"0.1\",
	\"supported_api_versions\": [4],
    \"license\": \"MIT\",
    \"nodes\": [
        \"Main.tscn\"
    ]
}
```
| Key      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| name | The extension name (in this case Example). |
| display_name | The name actually shown by Pixelorama in it's extension list (it can be anything). |
| author | Author of the extension. |
| version | version of the extension, it is a floating value so versions like 20.1.7 etc. are invalid. |
| supported_api_versions | (Optional) Announces the Api level of the extension. Pixelorama uses this to check compatibility between versions. |
| license | Name of license used by the extension. |
| nodes | Array containing name of scenes that should be instanced as soon extension gets enabled (in this case it is `Main.tscn`). |
:::tip Api Versions
`supported_api_versions` is an optional key that is used by Pixelorama to determine if it is compatible with it's Api ( E.g `[ 3 ]` means you are making extension for Pixelorama 0.11.x). If your extension is compatible with multiple api e.g (level 2 and 3) then use `[ 2, 3 ]`. To find the Api level of Pixelorama open the `project.godot` file in **Pixelorama's Source** and look for `config/ExtensionsAPI_Version`
:::
### Main.tscn
As mentioned above, the `Main.tscn` will be instanced in Pixelorama as soon as the extension gets enabled. a GdScript file (In this case `Main.gd`) is attached to this scene.
### Main.gd
As mentioned above, the `Main.gd` is a script written in GdScript, that will be run as soon as the extension gets enabled. It can be used to
- Instance further scenes (.tscn files).
- Or contain the core extension code.
The content of a basic `Main.gd` file is;
```
extends Node
# NOTE: use get_node_or_null(\"/root/ExtensionsApi\") to access the extension api.
# Runs as soon as extension is enabled. This script can act as a setup for the extension.
func _enter_tree() -> void:
	pass
func _exit_tree() -> void:  # Extension is being uninstalled or disabled
	# remember to remove things that you added using this extension
	pass

:::caution code version
The examples below assume you are developing for the latest Pixelorama release
:::
Below are some example codes for different basic types of extensions. To use them, [create an extension](extension_basics#making-an-extension) and paste your desired code from here to `Main.gd`;
- [Bare Minimum](#bare-minimum)
- [Add new Tab](#add-new-tab)
- [Add Menu Item](#add-menu-item)
- [Change Font](#change-font)
- [Project Manipulation](#project-manipulation)
- [Custom Exporter](#custom-exporter)
### Bare Minimum
The most basic code.
```
extends Node
# This script acts as a setup for the extension
func _enter_tree() -> void:
	pass
func _exit_tree() -> void:  # Extension is being uninstalled or disabled
	# remember to remove things that you added using this extension
	pass
```
### Add new Tab
Adds a simple Panel as a tab, which will be placed at the same place as the Tools tab by default.
```
extends Node
@onready var extension_api: Node  # Variable for keeping reference to the Api
# some references to nodes that will be created later
var panel
# This script acts as a setup for the extension
func _enter_tree() -> void:
	extension_api = get_node_or_null(\"/root/ExtensionsApi\")  # Accessing the Api
	# add a test panel as a tab  (this is an example) the tab is located at the same
	# place as the (Tools tab) by default
	panel = Panel.new()
	panel.name = \"This is a new panel\"  # This is optional
	extension_api.panel.add_node_as_tab(panel)
func _exit_tree() -> void:  # Extension is being uninstalled or disabled
	# remember to remove things that you added using this extension
	extension_api.panel.remove_node_from_tab(panel)
```
### Add Menu Item
Adds a menu item in Help menu, which displays a message when clicked on it.
```
extends Node
@onready var extension_api: Node  # Variable for keeping reference to the Api
var item_id: int
# This script acts as a setup for the extension
func _enter_tree() -> void:
	extension_api = get_node_or_null(\"/root/ExtensionsApi\")  # Accessing the Api
	var type = extension_api.menu.HELP
	item_id = extension_api.menu.add_menu_item(type, \"Show Message\", self)
	# the 3rd argument (in this case \"self\") will try to call \"menu_item_clicked\"
	# (if it is present)
func menu_item_clicked():
	# Do some stuff
	extension_api.dialog.show_error(\"You Tickled Me :)\")
func _exit_tree() -> void:  # Extension is being uninstalled or disabled
	# remember to remove things that you added using this extension
	extension_api.menu.remove_menu_item(extension_api.menu.HELP, item_id)
```
### Add a Theme
Adds a theme to pixelorama **Preferences > Interface > Themes** (you need to have a theme resource beforehand and that theme resource must derive from one of the [main pixelorama themes](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/tree/master/assets/themes))
```
extends Node
@onready var extension_api: Node  # Variable for keeping reference to the Api
var theme = load(\"res://path_to_some_theme.tres\") # Replace this with your theme resource
# your theme resource must be a derivative of themes from
# https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/tree/master/assets/themes
# or else a CRASH might occur
# if a theme from the extension was set in preferences, then it will be automatically be
# set when pixelorama is launched again
func _enter_tree() -> void:
	extension_api = get_node_or_null(\"/root/ExtensionsApi\")  # Accessing the Api
	if theme:
		extension_api.theme.add_theme(theme)  # Adds the theme to preferences
func _exit_tree() -> void:  # Extension is being uninstalled or disabled
	if theme:
		extension_api.theme.remove_theme(theme)  # Adds the theme to preferences
```
### Change Font
Sometimes you only need a different font instead of a different theme. This is much easier to achieve than adding themes.(you need to have a `.ttf` font resource beforehand)
```
extends Node
# used If your goal is to only use a different font
@onready var extension_api: Node  # Variable for keeping reference to the Api
var font_res = load(\"res://path_to_some_font.ttf\")  # Replace this with your font resource
var old_font
# This script acts as a setup for the extension
func _enter_tree() -> void:
	extension_api = get_node_or_null(\"/root/ExtensionsApi\")  # Accessing the Api
	if font_res:
		old_font = extension_api.general.get_global().control.theme.default_font.font_data
		#set the new font
		extension_api.general.get_global().control.theme.default_font.font_data = font_res
func _exit_tree() -> void:
	if font_res and old_font:
		#set the default font back again
		extension_api.general.get_global().control.theme.default_font.font_data = old_font
```
### Project Manipulation
Wish to automate some project behaviour? this will demonstrate some of the basic functions provided by the project api. This example adds a menu button to the edit menu and on clicking it some project manipulations (instructed in `menu_item_clicked()`) will get carried out.
```
extends Node
# I will show you some common stuff to manipulate projects
# (I will make use of the menu api as well)
# To know the available methods of (timeline) see:
# https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/blob/master/src/UI/Timeline/AnimationTimeline.gd
# NOTE: some more advanced methods can be accessed from timeline node (un-comment line below to get them)
#@onready var timeline = ExtensionsApi.general.get_global().animation_timeline
@onready var extension_api: Node  # Variable for keeping reference to the Api
var item_id: int
var type: int
func _enter_tree() -> void:
	extension_api = get_node_or_null(\"/root/ExtensionsApi\")  # Accessing the Api
	type = extension_api.menu.EDIT
	item_id = extension_api.menu.add_menu_item(type, \"Click Me 4 times\", self)
func _exit_tree() -> void:  # Extension is being uninstalled or disabled
	# remember to remove things that you added using this extension
	extension_api.menu.remove_menu_item(type, item_id)
################## Test Project methods whenever we click the menu button ############
var thing_to_do := 0
var new_project
var dest_img: Image
func menu_item_clicked():
	# Do some stuff
	if thing_to_do == 0:
		# get an image (For testing) from the current cel
		dest_img = extension_api.project.get_current_cel().get_image()
		# also make a new project
		new_project = extension_api.project.new_project([], \"Test\", Vector2(64, 64))
	if thing_to_do == 1:
		# To change something or get something in a project we must make it our \"current_project\" first
		extension_api.project.switch_to(new_project)
	if thing_to_do == 2:
		# Add 3 frames (the new_project will now have 4 total frames)
		for i in range(3):
			extension_api.project.add_new_frame(0)
	if thing_to_do == 3:
		# Add a PixelLayer
		extension_api.project.add_new_layer(0, \"I Love Pixelorama\")
	if thing_to_do == 4:
		# Now change content at {frame 3, layer 1} of \"new_project\"
		extension_api.project.set_pixelcel_image(dest_img, 2, 0)  # {frame 3, layer 1}
	thing_to_do += 1
```
### Custom Exporter
Adds a basic custom exporter that will export only odd frames. 
```
extends Node
@onready var extension_api: Node  # Variable for keeping reference to the Api
var id: int
func _enter_tree() -> void:
	extension_api = get_node_or_null(\"/root/ExtensionsApi\")  # Accessing the Api
	var exporter_info := {\"extension\": \".png\", \"description\": \"Only Alternate Frames\"}
	id = extension_api.exports.add_export_option(
		exporter_info, self, extension_api.exports.ExportTab.IMAGE, false
	)  # 2nd argument (in this case \"self\") must have \"override_export()\" in it's script
func _exit_tree() -> void:
	# remember to remove things that you added using this extension
	extension_api.exports.remove_export_option(id)
func override_export(details: Dictionary) -> bool:
	# in this function you take control of image processing and saving from pixelorama
	# return true for SUCCESS, false for FAILURE
	# the (details) include everything you could possibly need for exporting
	# keys of (details) are:
	# \"processed_images\", \"durations\", \"export_dialog\", \"export_paths\", \"project\"
	for i in range(0, details[\"processed_images\"].size(), 2):
		var image: Image = details[\"processed_images\"][i]
		var error = image.save_png(details[\"export_paths\"][i])
		if error != OK:
			return false
	return true
```",
"extensions_api.md": ":::tip
This is the documentation for Api version 5
:::
### Description
This Api gives you the essentials to develop a working extension for Pixelorama. To keep things organized, the Api is divided into
many smaller Apis, each giving access to different areas of the Software;
To access this anywhere in the extension use `get_node_or_null(\"/root/ExtensionsApi\")` e.g.
```
var api = get_node_or_null(\"/root/ExtensionsApi\")
```
:::tip
Keep in mind that this API is targeted towards users who are not fully familiar with Pixelorama's source code. If you need to do something more complicated and more low-level, you would need to interact directly with the source code.

## Q: Can I contribute to this project?
Yes! Read our [Ways to Contribute](development_and_contributing) page to learn more.",
"faq.md/Q: Does Pixelorama work on the Steam Deck?(10)": "
## Q: Does Pixelorama work on the Steam Deck?
A: It should! It works on Linux, so it should work on Steam Deck as well. Pixelorama also supports gamepad shortcuts, so you should be able to map the Steam Deck's buttons to actions such as undo/redo, copy, paste, etc. The reason we're not 100% certain is because we don't currently own a Steam Deck to test it ourselves.",
"faq.md/Q: How much does Pixelorama cost?(0)": "
## Q: How much does Pixelorama cost?
A: Pixelorama is available for the *extremely cheap price of $0.00!* That's right! Pixelorama is a [free and open-source software (FOSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), available under the (very permissive) [MIT license](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/blob/master/LICENSE)! In short:
- You are free to download and use Pixelorama for any purpose, personal, non-profit, commercial, or otherwise.
- You are free to modify, distribute, redistribute, and remix Pixelorama to your heart’s content, for any reason, both non-commercially and commercially.
However, the [Steam version](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2779170/Pixelorama/) is paid.",
"faq.md/Q: Is Pixelorama safe?(4)": "
## Q: Is Pixelorama safe?
A: Pixelorama is completely safe, as long as you download it from official sources (see `Q: What platforms is Pixelorama available on?` above). Its open-source nature allows for perfect transparency, thus it is impossible for us to sneak in malicious code without anyone noticing. The official builds are also being generated directly from the source code using GitHub Actions, so there is no worry that someone is sneaking in malicious code in the process of compiling. You may, however, get some security warnings from security software, such as Windows SmartScreen. The reason for this is that Pixelorama is not signed, and thus not recognized by the security system. You can safely ignore these warnings and proceed to run Pixelorama.",
"faq.md/Q: What are the minimum system requirements to run Pixelorama?(9)": "
## Q: What are the minimum system requirements to run Pixelorama?
A: Pixelorama is a relatively lightweight software and it should run on most devices, as long as OpenGL 3.3 / OpenGL ES 3.0 is supported.",
"faq.md/Q: What benefits does the Steam version provide?(2)": "
## Q: What benefits does the Steam version provide?
A: Users who buy Pixelorama through Steam will enjoy the benefits that Steam provides to all of the games and software hosted there, such as automatic updates and Steam Achievements. It is also a great way to fund the project's development! Apart from that, there will be no other difference between the non-Steam version. All of Pixelorama's features will be the same in all versions, and all versions will receive the same updates. In other words, the Steam version will **not** be a \"Pro\" version. It will be exactly the same as the non-Steam version, just with the added benefits that come naturally from Steam.",
"faq.md/Q: What engine is being used to develop Pixelorama? Where is the code hosted?(5)": "
## Q: What engine is being used to develop Pixelorama? Where is the code hosted?
A: Pixelorama is being developed with the Godot Engine (version 4.3), and since it is open-source anyone can contribute to it! The code is available on [Pixelorama's GitHub repository](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama)!",

"faq.md/Q: Will Pixelorama ever become Godot's Plugin?(7)": "
## Q: Will Pixelorama ever become Godot's Plugin?
A: Pixelorama was originally created as a stand-alone program. Our current focus is to keep improving it and not implementing it into Godot itself, but we are not declining the possibility of it being a plugin one day. However, if you are interested in direct Pixelorama support from Godot, you can use this amazing [Godot Pixelorama importer plugin](https://github.com/Technohacker/godot_pixelorama_importer) which can be used to make Godot import pxo files.",
"image_effects.md": "
You can apply multiple image effects to an image, to easily and quickly affect its content, without modifying it pixel by pixel. The image effects can be found under the Image menu.
:::warning
Image effects are **destructive**. This means that, once they are applied, they directly modify the image data, and the only way to reverse this change is by undoing. If you want to use a non-destructive workflow, use [layer effects](../concepts/layer#layer-effects) instead.
:::",
"image_effects.md/Animate image effects(1)": "
## Animate image effects
Some of these image effects can be animated. To animate an image effect, first create as many frames as you want the animation to last for, and select them. Then, open the image effect dialog you desire, and click on the small play icon on the top right side of the dialog. A new dialog will appear, containing all of the animatable properties. Select the property you wish to animate, toggle \"Animate\" on, and put the initial and final values, as well as the ease type and interpolation. Once you're done, click on \"OK\" on the image effect dialog, and the image effect will be applied to all of the selected frames, with the animatable properties you chose being automatically interpolated based on the position of each frame. This method can be used to easily make something move, rotate, etc, without having to edit each frame manually.
:::tip Affect active selection
By default, image effects will affect only the selected area of the cel(s). If there is no active selection, the entire cel(s) will be affected. If you have an active selection but want to affect the entire image, you can toggle off the \"Only affect selection\" checkbox in the dialog of the image effect you wish to apply.
:::
:::tip Affecting multiple cels at once
By default, image effects will apply in all of the currently selected cels. It is also possible to make them apply to the entire selected frame, to all frames of the project, and to all projects as well, by selecting one of these options from the option button found next to the \"Only affect selection\" checkbox, in the dialog of the image effect you wish to apply.

"image_effects.md/List of image effects(0)": "
## List of image effects
| Name      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Offset | Moves the pixels of the image to a new position. The moved pixels can optionally be wrapped around when they go out of bounds. For example, if a pixel leaves the canvas from the right, it re-appears on the left side. |
| Mirror | Mirrors the content of the image horizontally, vertically or both. |
| Rotate | Rotates the content of the image. Can change the angle, the pivot point, as well as the algorithm. There are seven rotation algorithms to choose from: Rotxel with Smear, cleanEdge, OmniScale, Nearest Neighbor (Shader), Nearest Neighbor, Rotxel and \"Upscale, Rotate and Downscale\". The first four are shader-based, meaning that they use the GPU, while the rest use the CPU. The algorithms that use the GPU tend to be faster. Rotxel with Smear can also create a smearing effect. |
| Outline | Generates an outline, with a given thickness, color and pattern. The outline is being generated outside the pixels that have transparent pixels are neighbors. If \"place inside image\" is toggled on, the outline is being drawn on these pixels themselves, rather than outside them. |
| Drop shadow | Creates a shadow of the image's content at a given offset, with a given color. |
| Invert colors | Inverts the colors of the image. Can choose whether this affects the red, blue, green or alpha channels, or multiple at once. |
| Desaturation | Desaturates the colors of the image, turning them to grayscale. Can choose whether this affects the red, blue, green or alpha channels, or multiple at once. |
| Adjust Hue/Saturation/Value | Adjusts the hue, saturation and the value of the colors of the image. |
| Palettize | Limits the number of colors of the image to the colors of the currently active palette. Each color is being mapped to the nearest color in the palette. |
| Pixelize | Pixelates the image by combining its pixels into larger squares, containing their average color. |
| Posterize | Limits the number of colors of the image to the posterization level. Can also set an optional dither intensity. |
| Gradient | Generates a gradient. Its colors can be modified from the gradient edit, by clicking on the colored area to add new color steps. Clicking on the color steps with the left mouse allows you to change the color of that step, and right clicking on a step, removes it. Gradients can either be linear or radial, and they can optionally be dithered and/or repeated. You can also generate step gradients by changing the interpolation type to constant. |
| Gradient map | Converts the colors of the image into a gradient, based on their lightness. Darker colors are mapped to colors on the left side of the gradient, and brighter colors are mapped to colors on the right side of the gradient. |",
"import.md": "
In Pixelorama, it is possible to import [.pxo files](../concepts/project/#pxo-files), image files, [palette files](palettes) and [extension files](../extension_system/extension_basics). To import a file, either `drag and drop` it into Pixelorama window or use `File > Open` dialog. You can also open files in Pixelorama through the your computer's file explorer by right clicking on a file, selecting \"Open with\" and selecting Pixelorama, but the process of making this work is different for each operating system/desktop environment. Doing this will open Pixelorama with the file automatically opened. You can also achieve the same thing by opening Pixelorama through the command line, and giving the names of the files you want to open as arguments.",
"import.md/Import image options(1)": "
## Import image options
When attempting to import an image, a dialog will appear, containing a preview of the image you want to import, along with options that let you change how you want the image to be imported.
![Import image dialog](../../static/img/import_options_dialog.png)
These options include:
- New project, that lets you open the image as a new project
- Spritesheet (new project), that lets you open the image as a spritesheet in a new project. You can manually set the amount of horizontal and vertical frames, or select \"smart slice\", which attempts to figure out the amount of frames in the spritesheet automatically.
- Spritesheet (new layer). Same as above, but instead of opening the spritesheet in a new project, it opens it as a new layer in the currently active project.
- New frame, which opens the image as a new frame in the currently active project. You can specify which layer the new frame will belong to.
- Replace cel, which replaces a cel at the frame and the layer of your choosing, with the imported image in the currently active project.
- New layer, which opens the image as a new layer in the currently active project. You can specify in which frame the new layer will be at.
- New reference image, which opens the image as a reference image in the currently active project.
- New palette, which creates a new [palette](palettes) using the colors of the imported image.
- New brush, which opens the imported image as a [brush](../concepts/brush). You can choose whether the new brush will be a file brush, a project brush, or a random brush.
- New pattern, which opens the imported image as a pattern, which can be used by the bucket tool.",
"import.md/Importing multiple images(2)": "
## Importing multiple images
When importing multiple images at the same time, the import dialogs will also have an \"apply to all\" checkbox. When toggling this on in a dialog, the rest of the dialogs will hide and all of the imported images will share the same options. This way you can easily import multiple images as multiple projects, frames, layers, etc. The order that they are being imported is backwards, meaning that the the last image that you attempted to import, will be the first one that actually gets opened. For example, if you attempt to import image files named `1.png`, `2.png` and `3.png` in that order as new frames, the first frame would be image `3.png`, then `2.png` and then `1.png`.",

"internal_extensions.md/Exporting your extension.(2)": "
## Exporting your extension.
When you are done making your extension and are ready to release and distribute your extension you have to convert your internal extension back to a regular extension.
1. Remove/comment the line that was added to `src/HandleExtensions.gd` (In step 5 of [Making an Extension, internal](#making-an-extension-internal))
2. From pixelorama, copy (not cut/move) your extension folder from `src/Extensions`, back to the `src/Extensions` folder of your project (replacing existing files).
3. Export your project by following [this tutorial](./extension_basics#exporting-the-extension).",
"internal_extensions.md/Making an Extension, internal(1)": "
## Making an Extension, internal
:::tip version control
To ensure your work isn't accidentally lost, it is highly recommended that you use version control (e.g Git) in your extension project and in pixelorama's source.
:::
1. First, make an extension project by following [this tutorial](./extension_basics#making-an-extension) (from here, it will now be referred to as **your project**).
2. Get and unzip the [source code](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/releases) of pixelorama that you intend to use for your extension.
3. Create an `Extensions` folder (case sensitive) in the pixelorama's source code in the `src` folder.
4. From your project, copy (not cut/move) the contents from `src/Extensions` folder to the `src/Extensions` folder in pixelorama (created in step 3).
5. Navigate to the `src/Extensions/(extension name)/extension.json` file and copy the value of the `name` key. Then open `src/HandleExtensions.gd` file in pixelorama's source and find the `_add_internal_extensions()` method. Modify and save it as follows:
    ```
    func _add_internal_extensions() -> void:
        _load_extension(\"ExtensionName\", true)  # Add this line, and replace `ExtensionName` with the value of your `name` key.
    ```
Now the extension has become internal. From here you can continue to code in the `Extensions/<your extension>` folder of pixelorama (just don't create any files in outside your extension folder).",

Welcome, fellow dreamer, to the documentation of Pixelorama: your free and open-source pixel-art creation tool, developed by Orama Interactive and our contributors. If you are new to this documentation, we recommend you start by learning [how to install the application](user_manual/installation), then reading the [User Interface Basics](user_manual/user_interface/user_interface_basics) page to familiarize yourself with Pixelorama's workspace. The ultimate goal of this program is to be able to keep up with the user's imagination and assist them in creating any kind of pixel art they wish. This could be a cool landscape, a dope animation, game graphics, random sketches or a well-thought pixelated meme. Thank you for researching our tool!
Here, you will understand the application's aspects, features, and tools from our tutorials. Eventually, you will be able to master it and apply it to your own pixelated goals. If you are an experienced pixel artist, familiar with most of Pixelorama's functionalities, you can search for some specific features and understand them better or get some ideas on how to creatively apply techniques you may not have thought of.

"layer.md": "
An artwork in Pixelorama can be consisted by several layers, giving you better control over different parts of the image, by allowing you to edit these parts without affecting any other part of the image. Layers are stacked on top of each other, which means that bottom layers are being drawn behind top layers. You can edit them in the [timeline](../user_manual/user_interface/timeline). Each layer consists of a [cels](cel), the number of which depends on the number of frames that the project has.",
"layer.md/Blend modes(1)": "
## Blend modes
The blend mode of each layer determines how its colors blend with the colors of the layer directly below it. Pixelorama supports the following blend modes:
| Name      | Category | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Passthrough | Normal | Only for group layers. Ignores group blending, like the group doesn't exist. |
| Normal | Normal | The blend layer colors are simply placed on top of the base colors. |
| Darken | Darken | Keeps the darker colors between the blend and the base layers. |
| Multiply | Darken | Multiplies the numerical values of the two colors, giving a darker result. |
| Color burn | Darken | Darkens by increasing the contrast between the blend and base colors. |
| Linear burn | Darken | Darkens the base colors based on the value of the blend colors. |
| Lighten | Lighten | Keeps the lighter colors between the blend and the base layers. |
| Screen | Lighten | Lightens the colors by multiplying the inverse of the blend and base colors. |
| Color dodge | Lighten | Lightens by decreasing the contrast between the blend and base colors. |
| Add | Lighten | Lightens by adding the numerical values of the two colors. Also known as linear dodge. |
| Overlay | Contrast | Like Screen mode in bright base colors and Multiply mode in darker base colors. |
| Soft light | Contrast | Similar to Overlay, but more subtle. |
| Hard light | Contrast | Like Screen mode in bright blending colors and Multiply mode in darker colors. |
| Difference | Inversion | Subtracts the blend color from the base or vice versa, depending on the brightness. |
| Exclusion | Inversion | Similar to Difference mode, but with less contrast between the colors. |
| Subtract | Inversion | Darkens by subtracting the numerical values of the blend colors from the base. |
| Divide | Inversion | Divides the numerical values of the base colors by the blend. |
| Hue | Component | Uses the blend hue while preserving the base saturation and luminosity. |
| Saturation | Component | Uses the blend saturation while preserving the base hue and luminosity. |
| Color | Component | Uses the blend hue and saturation while preserving the base luminosity. |
| Luminosity | Component | Uses the blend luminosity while preserving the base hue and saturation. |",
"layer.md/Clipping mask(3)": "
## Clipping mask
Clipping masks can be used to draw the content of the layer only on top of the non-transparent pixels of the layer directly below. In other words, the layer below the clipping mask is what controls the visibility of the content of the clipping mask. You can make a layer be a clipping mask by right-clicking the layer button in the timeline, and toggling \"Clipping mask\".",
"layer.md/Layer effects(2)": "
## Layer effects
Layer effects are image effects that are being applied to the layer in a non-destructive way. This means that they do not directly modify the image data, which allows artists to disable and enable them at will, without having to worry that their work will be modified in a permanent way. They are only being applied on [export](../user_manual/save_and_export), and they can be previewed in the canvas, if \"Display Layer Effects\" is enabled, under the View menu. Each layer can contain multiple layer effects.
To add a layer effect, you can click on the \"FX\" button in the layer area of the timeline. A window will appear, that lets you add, remove and change the order of layer effects. You can also change the properties of each effect. For a list of all available layer effects, see [image effects](../user_manual/image_effects#list-of-image-effects).
:::info Layer vs image effects
The difference between layer effects and image effects, is that layer effects can only be **applied per-layer** and are **non-destructive**, while image effects can be applied to **multiple cels** at the same time, and are **destructive**. Also, as of right now, layer effects cannot be animated.
:::",
"layer.md/Types of layers(0)": "
## Types of layers
Right now, there are three types of layers. Pixel layers, group layers, and 3D layers.
### Pixel layers
Pixel layers are the default and most straight forward type of layer. Their cels contain regular raster image data, in which you can normally draw and manipulate pixels. Pixel cels are the only types of cels that can be linked right now.
### Group layers
Group layers are used mostly for organization and their cels are empty and do not hold any actual data. They can be used to group common layers together, and they can expanded and collapsed from view in the timeline. If their blend mode is set to something other than passthrough, they blend all of their children together, and they can be used as clipping masks, and by clipping masks.
### 3D layers
The cels of 3D layers contain 3D mesh, lighting, camera and environment data, that are being rasterized based on the size of the canvas. They can contain lights, such as directional lights, spot lights and point lights, and a variety of primitive meshes, including boxes, capsules, spheres, cylinders, prisms, toruses, planes and even text. Importing custom .obj models is also possible.",

| `Right click` | Color will be right selected and set as the right tool color. |
| `Double click` | Double click on an existing color opens a color picker to change it's color. |
:::tip palette grid panning
If palette size is greater than `8x8` it can be panned in the grid either with sliders or `Middle click + Mouse drag`.
:::
### Tools {#palette-grid-tools}
Tools allow you to edit colors in the palette.
| Button | Tool | Description |
| -----  | ---- | ----------- |
| `+` | Add a new color | Left mouse click adds left tool color. Right mouse click adds right tool color. |
| `-` | Remove a selected color | Left mouse click removes left selected color. Right mouse click removes right selected color. |
| `↓` | Palette sorting options| A drop-down appears, containing the available sorting options. You can either apply the new color order directly to palette or to a copy of it. |
### Colors movement
Colors can be moved and copied around in the palette grid.
| Shortcut | Movement description |
| -------- | -------- |
| `Mouse drag` | Color switches with a color it is dropped on. |
| <kbd>Shift</kbd> + `Mouse drag` | Color is inserted where dropped. If dropped on another color the original color is moved to the right with every color next to it. |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + `Mouse drag` | Color is copied where dropped. If dropped on another color the original color is overwritten. |",

To import a palette, either `drag and drop` a palette file into Pixelorama window or use `File > Open` dialog.
An imported palette will be converted to `Pixelorama palette`, stored physically in the Pixelorama data folder and added to the palettes selection in `Palettes panel`.
The only exception to import behavior is `Image palette`. Importing an image to Pixelorama will open `Import Options` dialog in which you can select `Import as > New palette` to process an image to import a palette.
:::tip palette extraction
You can import any image as a palette and extract colors from it. Every color from the image will be added to the palette only once. With bigger images, it can take longer time to finish.
:::
### Supported formats
| Format | File extension |
| -------- | --------  |
| Pixelorama palette | .json |
| GIMP GPL | .gpl |
| PAL | .pal |
| Image palette | .png, .bmp, .hdr, .jpg, .jpeg, .svg, .tga, .webp |
:::caution file extensions
Palette format detection uses file extensions to determine how to parse palette formats. An incorrect extension will result in an import error.
:::
:::caution pre-1.0 pixelorama palettes
Palettes created in versions of Pixelorama prior to 1.0 cannot be reimported. The save format was changed from `.tres` to `.json`, due to security concerns. In order to convert an old palette to a new one, you can export it as an image from version 0.11.4, and import that image to the newest version.

## Palettes panel
![Pixelorama's Canvas](../../static/img/palettes-panel.png)
The top of the panel consists of [`tools`](#palette-grid-tools) (used to edit colors of the palette), `Palettes selector`, [`Edit palette button`](#editing-palette-metadata) and [`Add new palette button`](#creating-new-palette).
The main section is the [`Palette grid`](#palette-grid), displaying all colors present in the currently selected palette.
### Creating a new palette {#creating-new-palette}
![Pixelorama's Canvas](../../static/img/palette-create.png)
A new palette can be created by clicking `Add new palette button`.
#### Preset
You can select one of the presets to initialize a new palette with colors.
| Preset | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Empty | Empty palette with no colors. |
| From Current Palette | Palette will be created with colors copied from the currently selected palette. |
| From Current Sprite | Colors will be imported from the currently opened image. |
| From Current Selection | Colors will be imported from the current selection. |
#### Name
The name of the palette is also used as a palette file name.
#### Comment
The palette's description. Default Pixelorama palettes use this field to credit palette authors.
#### Width and Height
Palettes have set width and height (can be resized later) which define their grid size. Allowed values are from 1 to 64.
#### Create colors with alpha component
If this option is not toggled on, colors will be imported without alpha channel and transparency is ignored.
#### Get colors from
You can limit colors import to just some or all cels (as seen in the animation timeline).
| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Current frame | Colors imported from currently selected frame and all of its layers.  |
| Selected cels | Colors imported only from selected cels. |
| All frames | Colors imported from all frames and their layers. |
### Editing palette metadata {#editing-palette-metadata}
![Pixelorama's Canvas](../../static/img/palette-edit.png)
Currently, selected palette metadata can be edited with `Edit palette button`.
The majority of properties are identical to create a new palette dialog.
:::caution palette resizing
If the palette size is reduced positions of all colors will be reset to the beginning of the palette. If some colors don't fit in the new size they will be removed!
:::
#### Name
If the palette name is changed the file name will also be changed accordingly.
#### Path
Displays where exactly in the file system the palette file is located.
#### Delete button
Permanently removes the palette from the file system.",
"project.md": "
In Pixelorama, the term \"Project\" refers to the entire sprite, which contains all of the frames and layers it might have. Each project can be saved as a `.pxo` file. Multiple projects can be opened in Pixelorama at the same time, with each one having its own tab.
A project contains the following properties:
- The image data of each individual [cel](cel).
- The properties of the project itself, such as its name, size and FPS (frames per second).
- All of the properties of frames, [layers](layer), cels, animation tags, [guides](../user_manual/user_interface/canvas/#rulers-and-guides).
- [Brushes](brush) that are local to that specific project.",
"project.md/.pxo files(1)": "
## .pxo files
Pxo files are Pixelorama's custom file format that saves the entire content of the project. It cannot be opened in other image editors.
### File structure
The file format is essentially a .zip file in disguise. It contains a `data.json` file, and an `image_data` folder. The `data.json` file contains all of the project's metadata, such as project name, size, FPS, and the metadata of layers, frames, cels, etc. They are stored in JSON form, so they can easily be read by other software.
The `image_data` folder contains all of the image data. It contains another folder called `frames`, which in turn contains a folder for each `frame` of the project, and each frame folder contains the image data of every [cel](cel) that belongs to that frame. To preserve a non-destructive workflow, the cel image data are not affected by layer blend modes and layer effects. If the project has [brushes](brush), a `brushes` folder is also created, containing all of the brush image data. If you have enabled the option to include the blended images, the `image_data` folder will also contain all of the final image data for each frame. A final image is composed of every cel, with the layer effects applied to each cel, blended together into a single image, taking the blend modes of each layer into account.
In order for a software to read the data of a pxo, it has to open it as a zip file, and then it has to read the `data.json` file, and parse it as JSON object. Then, it either has to loop through the all of the folders included in `image_data/frames`, where each folder contains the cel data for each frame separately, or, if the final blended images are included and that's all we care about, it just has to loop through all of the images inside the `image_data` folder, where each image corresponds to every frame of the project, and import them.
### Include blended images
During save, you are given the option to select if the blended images will be included in the exported file. If enabled, the final blended images are also being stored in the pxo, for each frame. This makes the pxo file larger and is useful for importing by third-party software or [CLI exporting](../user_manual/cli). Loading pxo files in Pixelorama does not need this option to be enabled.",
"project.md/Saving a project(0)": "
## Saving a project
See [this page](../user_manual/save_and_export/#saving) to learn how to save a project.",
"save_and_export.md": "
You can either save or export your projects. Saving a project will create a [.pxo file](../concepts/project/#pxo-files), which is Pixelorama's custom file format, while exporting means that one (or multiple, in case of animations) `.png`(s), an `.apng`, or a `.gif` file will be created.
:::tip saving vs exporting
Basically, you should **save** your project if you intend to use it again on Pixelorama and keep all of your data, such as layers, [project brushes](../concepts/brush/#project-brushes), animation tags, etc. While, if you want to share your artwork, import it in another software such as a game engine, or view it on an image editor, you should **export** it. Of course, nothing is stopping you from doing both, which is actually the recommended approach.
:::",
"save_and_export.md/Exporting(1)": "
## Exporting
To export your project, you can go to the File menu and select `Export...`, or press <kbd>Control + E</kbd>, and a window will appear. If you are using a Desktop version, you will be able to choose where you want the file to be saved. If you use the Web version, you will be asked for a file name and the `.png`, `.apng` or `.gif` file(s) will be downloaded by your browser.
Just like with save, you have to use the `Export as...` option or <kbd> Shift + Control + E</kbd> to export to a new directory.
You can choose what you want to export by clicking on one of the tabs on the top of the window.
:::tip resize while exporting
If you draw on a small canvas, the exported image will have a relatively slow resolution. Some software and websites tend to blur small images, which can make pixel art look bad. To avoid that, you are also given the option to resize on export, with a chosen interpolation method. This is useful when you want to share your art and make it easier for people to preview it. For most cases, sticking with the default Nearest interpolation should be fine.
:::
You can choose which frames you want to save by changing the \"Frame\" option below the preview. The default setting is to include all frames, but you can set it to only include the currently selected frame, or select specific tags. Similarly, you can select which layers you want to include by changing the \"Layers\" option. You are also given the option to select the animation direction from either forward, backward or a ping-pong loop.
### Export a sequence of images
![Export Images](../../static/img/export_images.png)
By default, the export window is set to export a sequence of images, one for each frame, either as multiple files, or as a single animated file, if the file format is set to an animated image format, such as `.gif` or `.apng`.
If you save your animation as multiple files, then every file will have a number attached to its name. For example, if the name is `filename.png`, the exported file names will be `filename_0001.png`, `filename_0002.png`, `filename_0003.png` and so on. In the advanced options, you can find options to change the separator character(s) (in the above example, the character is the underscore (`_`), which is also the default). If these frames also have a frame tag, the name of the tag can be included in the file name as well, by enabling \"Include frame tags in the file name\". You can also choose to automatically create a new directory for each frame tag for extra organization, by enabling \"Create new folder for each frame tag\". This will place all of the frames of the same tag in a different directory.
Keep in mind that if you are working with a large canvas size and/or multiple frames, the `.gif` exporting process can be slow. Until we speed up the process, it is recommended to export to `.apng` and use another tool, such as https://ezgif.com/apng-to-gif, to convert the `.apng` file to `.gif`.
### Export a spritesheet
![Export Spritesheet](../../static/img/export_spritesheet.png)
You can save the entire animation as a single image containing all of the frames. This is called a `spritesheet`. You can choose how many rows and columns you want your animation to be split into, in the spritesheet. Spritesheets can also be imported into Pixelorama.

To save a project, you can go to the File menu and select `Save..`, or press <kbd>Control + S</kbd>, and a window will appear. If you are using a Desktop version, you will be able to choose where you want the file to be saved. If you use the Web version, you will be asked for a file name and the `.pxo` file will be downloaded by your browser.
By selecting `Save...` again on a project you have already saved, the file name and path you chose before will still be automatically used, which means that the old file will be replaced with a new one with the changes you have made.

"selecting.md": "
You can select specific areas of your sprite to make changes at. When there is an available selection, any operation such as drawing, shading and image effect application will only affect the selected part(s) of the drawing. Selections also allow you to easily [apply transformations to specific parts of the image, such as moving and scaling](transforming). An active selection is denoted by a [marching ants effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_ants) around the selected pixels.",
"selecting.md/Copy, Paste, Cut and Delete(3)": "
## Copy, Paste, Cut and Delete
If you have an active selection, you can copy its contents by pressing <kbd>Control + C</kbd>. Then, you can paste it whenever you like, either on the same cel, on another cel or even a completely different project with <kbd>Control + V</kbd>. Pasting will create a new transformation which will be created at the same position as the original selection was when it was copied, but you will easily be able to move it to where you want. Keep in mind that copy/paste **does not** work at an Operating System level. Meaning, you won't be able to copy/paste image data between different applications on your device.
You can also easily delete the selected content with the <kbd>Delete</kbd> key. You can also cut with <kbd>Control + X</kbd>. Cut basically copies the selected content and then immediately deletes it.
Keep in mind that all of these operations only affect the currently selected cel and not the entire layer as of right now. You can also use the Edit menu to find these options instead of using keyboard shortcuts.",
"selecting.md/Duplicating(2)": "
## Duplicating

"selecting.md/Modifying Selections(1)": "
## Modifying Selections
The selection tools also give you the ability to modify the already existing selection, by either adding to it, removing from it or creating intersections. By default, the selection tools replace the already existing selection with a new one. Keep in mind that you have to **press the keyboard modifiers first before the mouse button is pressed.**
- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + Mouse click = Add to selection.
- <kbd>Control</kbd> + Mouse click = Subtract from the selection.
- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + Mouse click = Create selection intersection.
### Selecting All
You can easily select the entire canvas by either pressing <kbd>Control + A</kbd>, or by going to the Select menu and pressing **All**.
### Clearing Selection
If you want to delete the entire selection, the easiest way is to deselect everything. You can do that by either pressing <kbd>Control + D</kbd>, or by going to the Select menu and pressing **Clear**. If you have the rectangular selection, elliptical selection, magic wand or lasso tools selected, clicking anywhere outside the canvas also clears the selection.
### Inverting Selection
Inverting the selection means that all of the currently selected pixels will get deselected, while all of the unselected pixels will get selected. You can do this by either pressing <kbd>Control + I</kbd>, or going to the Select menu and pressing **Invert**. If you have everything selected, inverting will clear the selection. Likewise, if you have nothing selected, inverting will select everything.",

## Selection Tools
You can use one of the available selection tools in Pixelorama. Each tool selects things slightly differently.
| Name      | Description | Default Shortcut |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Rectangular Selection | Create a rectangular selection.| L: <kbd>R</kbd>, R: <kbd> Alt + R</kbd> |
| Elliptical Selection | Create an elliptical selection. | L: <kbd>Y</kbd>, R: <kbd> Alt + Y</kbd> |
| Polygonal Selection | Create a polygonal selection. Click where you want each point of the polygon to be. Double click to end your polygon and finalize your selection area. | L: <kbd>K</kbd>, R: <kbd> Alt + K</kbd> |
| Select By Color | Selects all parts of the cel that share the same color.| L: <kbd>W</kbd>, R: <kbd> Alt + W</kbd> |
| Magic Wand | Selects the neighboring same-color area of the pixel the cursor was in on mouse button press. | L: <kbd>Q</kbd>, R: <kbd> Alt + Q</kbd> |
| Lasso / Free Select Tool | Selects a rough outline of an area. | L: <kbd>F</kbd>, R: <kbd> Alt + F</kbd> |
Similar to the [shape drawing tools](drawing), you can use keyboard shortcuts to modify how the rectangular and elliptical selections are being created.
- Mouse click + <kbd>Shift</kbd> = Create a 1:1 (square/circle) selection.
- Mouse click + <kbd>Control</kbd> = Create a selection that expands from the center.
- Mouse click + <kbd>Alt</kbd> = Displaces the origin of the selection.
You can also easily change the selection's position and size from the tool options if you have a selection tool pressed. Keep in mind that if there is an active transformation, the content inside the selected parts will be affected as well. Otherwise, these options only affect the selection itself and not its content.",
"shading.md": "
Pixelorama's shading tool can be used to easily add lighting and shadows to the artwork. You can use it the same way you use the [Pencil or Eraser tools](drawing), you mouse press on where the pixels of the sprite where you want to apply the shading. Similar to Pencil and Eraser, you can change the affected area size and brush. As of right now, there are two modes of shading, Simple Shading and Hue Shifting, which you can switch from the tool's options.",
"shading.md/Color Replace(2)": "
## Color Replace
This mode is pretty much self explainatory. The user selects an array of colors by first selecting a color on the palette and then specifying the number of colors to pick after it through the `Colors right` slider. When shading, if a color is present in the chosen array of colors, it then gets replaced by the next (or previous) color in the array, depending on your current lighten/darken mode.
![Color replace mode properties](../../static/img/shading_cr.png)
##### Properties of the Color replace shading mode.",
"shading.md/Hue Shifting(1)": "
## Hue Shifting
Hue Shifting is a bit more complex than Simple Shading. Instead of just shifting the `Value` of the color, we also shift their `Hue` and `Saturation` too. When we are brightening the colors, we shift their hue to move towards yellow (the limit is set to roughly 60 Hue), decrease their saturation and increase their value. On the contrary, when we are darkening the colors, their hue shifts towards blue (the limit is set to roughly 240 Hue), their saturation increases and their value decreases. This is all done automatically by the Shading tool, but you can also configure the amount the Hue, Saturation and Value change from the tool options.
Here is a video by Brandon James Greer that explains the concept of hue shifting.
<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PNtMAxYaGyg?si=zuahArZTx17avYvN\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>
:::caution hue shifting limits
The hue shifting mode does not always change the hue, saturation and value of the colors exactly as much as the values have been set by the user. For example, a color with a hue of 70 and the shading tool set to hue shifting, lighten and a hue of, let's say, 20, will not result in a color with a hue of 50 (because 70 - 20 = 50), but it will rather stay limited to 60, as this is the hard limit of lighting. Similarly, the hard hue limit of darkening is 240. If you want to exactly change the HSV values of a color, you can use the `Adjust Hue/Saturation/Value` image effect under the Image menu.
:::",
"shading.md/Simple Shading(0)": "
## Simple Shading
This is a fairly straightforward method of shading. You can choose to either lighten or darken the area where you clicked, as well as the shading value. The bigger the number, the more shading will be applied. All it does is simply increase (with lighting) or decrease (with shading) the `Value` of the pixel's colors, which represents the color's brightness. It essentially just makes the same colors brighter or darker.",

The timeline's main purpose is to help you with creating animations. It is composed of frames, which are used for creating animations, and layers, which help you separate your frames in different parts. Each frame is essentially a collection of multiple layers, and each individual intersection of a frame and a layer is called a [cel](../../concepts/cel). All frames have the same amount of layers.
![Screenshot of Pixelorama's timeline](../../../static/img/timeline_cels.png)",
"timeline.md/Animation(0)": "
## Animation
To preview your animation, you can click on the `Play` button (or press <kbd>F5</kbd>) located on the top right side of the timeline. The button on the left (mapped to <kbd>F4</kbd>) is used to preview the animation backward.
### FPS
On the top and far right side of the timeline, you will see a number, which has the default value of 6. This is the FPS, which stands for `Frames Per Second`. To put it simply, this is the speed of the animation and it determines how many frames are being shown for every second. Having a value of 6 FPS, for example, will display 6 frames every second the animation is running.
For more details, you can read this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate).
### Loop modes
The button located directly on the left of the FPS is used to change the animation loop mode. There are three loop modes:
- Cycle loop. When the animation reaches the final frame, it will start playing again from the first frame. This is the default option.
- Ping-pong. When the animation reaches the final frame, it begins playing backward, starting from that final frame. When it reaches the first frame, it will again start playing forward until it reaches the final frame, and so on.
- No loop. When the animation reaches the final frame, it simply stops playing.
### Onion skinning
Directly on the left of the loop mode button, you will find two buttons used for onion skinning. Onion skinning is useful for animations because it's a simple and easy way to preview the previous and next frames at the same time as the frame you are currently editing. For more details, you can read this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_skinning).
The button on the right simply toggles onion skinning on and off, and the one on the left brings up options, like the amount of past (previous) and future (next) frames that appear, and blue-red mode, which tints the previous frames blue, and the next frames red.
:::tip ignore onion skinning
If you want a layer to ignore onion skinning simply add the \"_io\" suffix in its name.

"timeline.md/Cels(3)": "
## Cels
Cels are the intersection of layers and frames. For a more detailed explanation, you can [read this page](../../concepts/cel). To select a cel in order to draw on it, you can left-click on their respective button. The cel buttons take the most space in the timeline, and they are located to the right of the layer buttons and below the frame buttons. They also have a small preview of their image data on them.
Right-clicking on a cel button will bring up a menu, with options such as properties, link (or unlink) cel, and delete, which clears the content of the cel, making it fully transparent. In the cel properties, you can change their opacity (cel opacity is different than layer opacity), their z-index and also set custom user-defined data.
:::tip Selecting multiple cels
You can select/deselect multiple cels by holding the <kbd>Control</kbd> key and left-clicking individual cels, or hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key and left-click a cel to also select all of the cels between the one that was clicked and the one that has been selected last.
This also works on frame and layer buttons. For example, selecting two frame buttons using <kbd>Control</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd> will select all of their cels as well. The same is true for layer buttons.
:::
:::tip Drag and drop
You can drag and drop layer, frame and cel buttons to re-arrange them. Re-arranging frame and layer buttons also affects their cels.
:::",
"timeline.md/Frames(2)": "
## Frames
Directly above the cels, you will notice some buttons with each one having a number. These are the frame buttons, and the number they have is their order in the animation.
Clicking on a frame button will select that frame, and right-clicking a frame button will open up a menu. The menu options include frame properties, remove frame, clone frame, move frame to the left, move frame to the right, new tag, reverse frames (only works when multiple frames are selected), and center frames. Clicking on frame properties brings up a window that lets you change the duration of that frame, as well as set custom user-defined data.
:::tip frame duration
By default, the duration of each frame is set to 1x, which means it will take exactly as much time as the timeline FPS (frames per second). Setting it to 2x, for example, that frame will take twice as much time, while setting it to 0.5x will take half the time, meaning it will play out faster.
:::
You can also drag and drop frame buttons to re-arrange them. This will also affect their corresponding cels.
On the top side of the timeline, you will find frame-related buttons which offer the same functionality as the frame button right-click menu, like adding, removing, cloning and moving frames.
### Frame tags
Frame tags are used to organize different parts of your animated sprite. Those parts can also be exported independently using frame tags.
To create a new tag, you can right click on a frame button and select \"New Tag\". A popup will appear that lets you set a name for the tag, a color, the starting (from) and ending (to) frame, as well as custom user-defined data.
To edit an already existing tag, you can click on its name on the timeline, above the frame area. You can quickly move and resize it by dragging its edges.
If \"Animation plays only on frames of the same tag\" is toggled on in the timeline options, then, when you preview your animation, it will only preview the frames that belong on the same tag as the currently selected frame. This is a great way to preview parts of your animation separately.",
"timeline.md/Layers(1)": "
## Layers
On the left side of the timeline, you will see the layer buttons. Clicking on a layer button will select the current layer. Double-clicking will let you change the name of that layer. Right clicking a layer button will open up a menu, with options such as the layer's properties, and whether it's a clipping mask or not.
The layer buttons have three more buttons on them. The first toggles the layer's visibility. While invisible, the layer cannot be edited by the user. It will also remain invisible on export. The second locks and unlocks the layer. If the layer is locked, it cannot be edited by the user, but it does remain visible. The third button is used to automatically link the new cels that are being created. If it's toggled on, it is essentially a fast way to create linked cels.
There are 7 more buttons located on top of the layers. These, in order of appearance: add a new layer, remove the currently active layer, move the current layer up and down, clone the current layer, merge the current layer with the one directly below it, and open up a dialog for layer effects. Below these buttons, you can change the selected layer's blend mode and opacity.",

:::
In Pixelorama, you are given the ability to map a different tool to each mouse button, left and right. This essentially means that you can use a different tool with your left mouse button, and a different tool with your right mouse button. The two mouse buttons can be used **independently** of one another. In the toolbar, you will see one of the tool buttons having a half background on the left side of the button as **blue**. This represents the left mouse button, and it means that this specific tool has been **mapped to the left mouse button**. Similarly, the tool button with that has has a half background on the right side as **orange is mapped to the right mouse button**. If a tool button has both a blue and orange background, then this means that this tool has been mapped to both left and right mouse buttons.
So, to sum up, blue represents the left mouse button and orange represents the right mouse button. To map a tool to your left mouse button you can left-click the button of the tool you want to map in the toolbar, and to map a tool to your right mouse button you can right-click the tool button.
When you are on your [canvas](user_interface/canvas), if you left-click, the tool that you left-clicked on the toolbar will be used and if you right-click, the tool that you right-clicked will be used.

"tools.md/Tool options(2)": "
## Tool options
Almost every tool has certain properties that the user can tweak, such as brush type and size, different modes, color or mirroring. The tool options are located in the right side of the application window and they are separated in left tool and right tool settings. These, of course, correspond to the two tools you have mapped at your two mouse buttons. The two colors are also mapped to different mouse buttons. The left one is for the left mouse button tool, and the right one is for the right mouse button tool.
:::note Change mode quickly!
Most of the tools have some binary property that has to be changed often. Holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> will allow you to quickly alternate between the properties for a given tool as follows:
:::
| Tool | Alternating Property |
| ---- | -------------------- |
| Zoom | Zoom in / Zoom out |
| Color picker | Pick for left color / Pick for right |
| Pencil | Overwrite color on / off |
| Bucket | Fill same color area / Fill same color pixels |
| Shading | Lighten / Darken option |
The tool options change every time the user changes the available tool, and most tools have their own unique options.

"transforming.md": "
Currently, there are three types of transformations in Pixelorama. Translation (moving), scale and rotation. Transformations can either affect the currently active entire cels, or [selections](selecting).
Keep in mind that **any content moved outside the canvas boundaries will be lost**.",
"transforming.md/Having An Active Transformation(3)": "
## Having An Active Transformation
When moving or scaling a selection with its contents, the selected pixels will suddenly become transparent. This indicates that a selection transformation has started. This means that your changes haven't yet been applied to the image. When there is an active transformation, moving and scaling will only affect the transformed content and nothing else, until it is applied.
### Applying A Transformation
To apply your changes, you can either press <kbd>Enter</kbd>, or by doing any other action, such as drawing, applying an image effect, selecting another cel, adding a new frame or layer, etc. Doing any of these will automatically apply your changes.
### Canceling A Transformation
To cancel a transformation, you can either press <kbd>Escape</kbd> or undo. You will not be able to redo your actions if you decide to cancel.",
"transforming.md/Move(0)": "
## Move
To move pixels around in the canvas, you can use the Move tool. It works by simply holding the mapped mouse button and dragging the cursor to where you want to move the content. If there is no active selection, it will move the entire content of the active cels. If there is a selection, it will start a selection transformation, and it will move both the selection itself and its content. To move a selection, it is also possible to use a selection tool and click inside the selected area and, while the mapped mouse button is being held, drag the cursor, just like you do with the Move tool. There are some keyboard shortcuts that can help you with movement. **The order of the key press and mouse button press matters for the selection tools.**
- Mouse movement + <kbd>Shift</kbd> = Moves & snaps selection to an axis.
- Mouse movement + <kbd>Control</kbd> = Moves & snaps selection to the rectangular grid.
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + Mouse movement = Moves selection without content. **This only works for the selection tools and not the Move tool.**
- <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + mouse movement = Copies selection and moves it without cutting it from the original position. This is basically a quick way to copy and move stuff around without <kbd>Control + C</kbd> and <kbd>Control + V</kbd>. **This only works for the selection tools and not the Move tool.**
If you have a selection tool active, you can also use the arrow keys to move the selection and contents. Pressing <kbd>Alt</kbd> only moves the selection without content, and holding <kbd>Control</kbd> moves the selection by the size of the rectangular grid tiles. You can also manually change the position of the selection from the tool options. If there is an active transformation, the content will be affected as well, otherwise, it will only move the selection itself without its content.",
"transforming.md/Rotate(2)": "
## Rotate
To rotate your image, you can go to the Image menu and select Rotate Image. There, you can choose one of the three rotation algorithms. You can experiment with every one of them to see what works best for you. You are also given the option to only affect the selected part of the image or the entire area of the active cels. In the future, there will most likely be gizmos that rotate the selection directly, just like there are for scaling.",
"transforming.md/Scale(1)": "
## Scale
To resize your image, you can go to the Image menu and select **Scale Image**. There you can choose the new size of your entire [project](../concepts/project). You can also just expand the canvas without affecting the content that is inside by going to the Image menu and pressing **Resize Canvas**. Furthermore, you can go to Image -> Crop Image, which will remove all of the transparent pixels that surround your drawing, by shrinking the size of the image. Of course, all of these options will affect all of the cels of the project.
If you want you resize only selected part(s) of your artwork, you can create a [selection](selecting) and use one of the eight gizmos that appear on each side of the selection borders. To use them, you can simply left-click on them, hold, then move your cursor. Moving it outwards will expand the size, while moving it inwards will shrink it. Using gizmos will start a selection transformation. Like with movement, there are some keyboard shortcuts you can use to give you more control over the transformation.
- Mouse click + <kbd>Shift</kbd> = Keeps the original aspect ratio of the selection.
- Mouse click + <kbd>Control</kbd> = Expands from the center.
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + Mouse click = Only affects the selection and not the content.
You can also manually change the size of the selection from the tool options. If there is an active transformation, the content will be affected as well, otherwise, it will only scale the selection itself without its content.",

## Error code 12 when exporting png files
![Error code 12](../static/img/error_code_12.png)
This error has only been spotted in the Windows platform. Sometimes, when exporting png files, the process may fail due to \"Error code 12\". This most likely happens when you try to export in a directory that is protected by **anti-virus software**. To resolve it, you can try tweaking the settings of your anti-virus to either whitelist Pixelorama or disable folder protection. We can't guarantee that this will work, as it also depends on what anti-virus software you are using. Alternatively, you can export in a directory that is not protected by the anti-virus.
It is also possible that this issue may be solved if you run Pixelorama as an administrator.
If neither of these works, you could save your projects as a pxo file, open the Web version, drag and drop the pxo file there, and export the png file from the Web version.",

## I have performance issues, Pixelorama is very slow on my machine
We are doing our best to optimize the performance. That being said, you can improve the performance of the app significantly by trying the following:
- Change the **app's** maximum framerate, in order to reduce CPU usage. To do that, you can go to the Edit menu, Preferences and then click the Performance tab. There, you can set a maximum value for the FPS in \"Set application FPS limit:\". Keep in mind that the lower the number, the lower the CPU usage, but the application gets slower, choppier and unresponsive, so make sure not to set it *too low*. 0 means that there is no limit.
- If you have any group layers, try setting their blend mode to \"Passthrough\".

## Pixelorama crashed while I was working on my project!
Crashes are unfortunate, and while we are doing our best to fix them, some issues causing the application to crash may have escaped our grasp. The good news is that you can enable **automatic backups**, that save your work every a certain time interval. You can enable them from the Edit menu, Preferences, Backup and then by ticking on \"Enable autosave\".
![Enable Autosave](../static/img/enable_autosave.png)
Besides that, it is **strongly recommended** that you save often, and keep copies of your files as backups in case something gets lost.
You can also aid us in our fight against crashes by [reporting issues on GitHub](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues) and uploading the content of Pixelorama's log files. You can find the log files in `C:\\Users\\[USERNAME]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Pixelorama\\logs` on Windows, `~/.local/share/Pixelorama/logs` on Linux and `/Users/[USERNAME]/Library/Application Support/Pixelorama/logs` for macOS. It is also extremely helpful, if not necessary, to be as specific as possible with the steps that led to the crash. By giving us specific steps to reproduce the issue, we can solve it faster.",

"user_interface_basics.md": "
Pixelorama aims for a simplistic and understandable, yet professional User Interface (from now on referred as \"UI\"). Optimized for quick access to everything, Pixelorama's UI looks like this:
![A screenshot of Pixelorama's UI which has been edited to have its interface numbered.](../../../static/img/ui-introduction.png)
##### A screenshot of Pixelorama's UI which has been edited to have its interface numbered. Note that the image above is the default look of Pixelorama (using the default dark theme), right after you have closed the splash screen.
Now, let's categorize the common elements of which the UI is consisted of and give everything a short description.
- **1** - The traditional top bar with menus found in most windowed applications.
- **2** - The [toolbar](../tools). The area where you can select a tool to work with.
- **3** - The [canvas](canvas) area. Located in the middle of your view, the canvas is the \"sheet\" on which you are creating your artwork. This is the main area of the workspace because this is where you will be doing all of the drawing. On the top side you will also find the project tabs, where all of your currently opened projects are. You can switch between them by clicking on their respective tab.
- **4** - The [timeline](timeline). This is where you will find the projects's layers and frames for animation.
- **5** - The global tool options, which contain some settings such as mirroring, pixel perfect, alpha lock and dynamics that are being shared between both the left and the right tool.
- **6** - The color picker, where you can change the colors of the left and right tools.
- **7** - The [tool options](../tools/#tool-options). This is where you can configure some settings of your currently active tools.
- **8** - The [palettes](../palettes). Useful for easily picking pre-set colors.
:::tip Hidden panels
There are even more panels in Pixelorama, but they are hidden by default. To make them visible, you can go to the top bar menu, select Window, Panels, and toggle on the panels you wish to make visible. You can hide them by toggling them off the same way.

## UI customization
The user interface of Pixelorama is very customizable, allowing you to re-arrange the panels however you want. To move a panel, you have to enable \"Moveable Panels\" from the Window menu (or press F9, which is its default shortcut). This will make each panel have their own tab. Click with your left mouse button (or touch, if you are using a touch screen) on the tab of the panel you wish to move, and drag it to the area you want to move it to. A highlight will appear while dragging, which lets you know of the space the panel will take once you finish dragging.

## UI layouts
You also have the ability to make custom layouts of the user interface. You can change the layout by going to the Window menu, and selecting a layout from the Layouts submenu. If you want to save the current state of the UI as a layout, you can go to the Window menu, and, under Layouts, select \"Manage Layouts\". A dialog will appear, where you can add a new layout that is based of the current state of the user interface, and you can rename and delete other layouts. Clicking on a layout in that dialog will show a preview of how that layout looks like, and double clicking it will apply it to the UI."
